<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">INTRODUCTORY.&mdash;CANADIAN TERRITORY AND
POPULATION.</p>
<p>Lunching one day in Toronto with one of the aldermen of that
thriving city (I may as well frankly state that we had
turtle-soup on the occasion), he remarked that he had been in
London the previous summer, and that he was perfectly astonished
at the idea Englishmen seemed to have about Canada.&nbsp; He was
particularly indignant at the way in which it was coolly assumed
that the Canadians were a barbarous people, planted in a
wilderness, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>ignorant of civilization, deficient in manners and
customs&mdash;a well-meaning people, of whom in the course of
ages something might be made, but at present in a very nebulous
and unsatisfactory state.&nbsp; It seems my worthy friend had
gone to hear a popular Q.C.&mdash;a gentleman of Liberal
proclivities, very anxious to write M.P. after his
name&mdash;deliver a lecture to the young men of the Christian
Association in Exeter Hall on Canada.&nbsp; Never was a man more
mortified in all his life than was the alderman in
question.&nbsp; All the time the lecture was being delivered, he
said, he held down his head in shame.&nbsp; &lsquo;I felt,&rsquo;
said he, rising to a climax, &lsquo;as if I must
squirm!&rsquo;&nbsp; What &lsquo;squirming&rsquo; implies the
writer candidly admits that he has no idea.&nbsp; Of course, it
means something very bad.&nbsp; All he can say is, that it is his
hope and prayer that in the following pages he may set no
Canadian squirming.&nbsp; He went out to see the nakedness, or
the reverse, of the land, to ask <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the emigrants how they were getting
on, to judge for himself whether it was worth any
Englishman&rsquo;s while to leave home and friends to cross the
Atlantic and plant himself on the vast extent of prairie
stretching between Winnipeg and the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; What
he heard and saw is contained in the following pages, originally
published in the <i>Christian World</i>, and now reproduced as a
small contribution to a question which rises in importance with
the increase of population and the growing difficulty of getting
a living at home.</p>
<p>As a rule, the English know little more of Canada than that it
belongs to us&mdash;that it is very cold there in winter and very
hot in summer.&nbsp; I happened to be on board the
<i>Worcester</i> training-ship on the last occasion of the prizes
being given away, and was not surprised to find that Canada was
especially referred to as illustrating the defective geographical
knowledge of the young cadets.&nbsp; In <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the <i>London Citizen</i> a few weeks
later there was still grosser display of ignorance on the part of
a writer who had gone to Montreal to attend the meetings of the
British Association there, and who complained bitterly of the
lack of garden-parties and champagne lunches.&nbsp; This victim
of misplaced confidence owned that he had to put up with tea and
coffee and non-intoxicating beverages when he did so far
condescend as to accept Canadian hospitality.&nbsp; Yet the
writer of that letter was a barrister, at this very time a
candidate for Parliament.&nbsp; Had he an atom of common-sense,
he might have known&mdash;this distinguished barrister and
ornament of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science&mdash;that Canada is a young country; that its wealth is
still undeveloped; that the greater part of it is prairie; that
the settler&mdash;in his heroic efforts to subdue Nature, to make
the wilderness to rejoice and blossom as the rose, to build up a
grand nation in that quarter <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of the globe, to spread in a region
larger than the United States the Anglo-Saxon laws and
civilization and tongue&mdash;has to renounce luxury, to scorn
delights, to live laborious days.&nbsp; Canada is not the place
for members of the British Association who long for the
flesh-pots of Egypt or the champagne-cup.&nbsp; In Canada one has
to live simply and to work hard.&nbsp; He who does so work,
though in England he may die a pauper, there becomes a man.&nbsp;
Canada offers to all independence, a fertile soil, a bracing
air.&nbsp; At present there is little chance of the majority of
its people being enervated by luxury or demoralized by
wealth.</p>
<p>Canada is a country, however, with room and scope for millions
who must starve and die in Europe.&nbsp; Its area is 3,470,392
square miles, and its most southern point reaches the 42nd
parallel of latitude.&nbsp; It possesses thousands of square
miles of the finest forests on the continent, widely spread coal
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>fields,
extensive and productive fisheries, and rivers and lakes of
unequalled extent.&nbsp; The country is divided into eight
provinces, as follows: Nova Scotia, containing 20,907 square
miles; New Brunswick, 27,174; Prince Edward Island, 2,133;
Quebec, 188,688; Ontario, 101,733; Manitoba, 123,200; the North
West, 2,665,252; British Columbia, 341,305.&nbsp; Newfoundland
lies outside the Dominion, for reasons best known to itself.</p>
<p>According to the census taken in 1881, the population at that
time numbered 4,324,810, distributed as follows: Nova Scotia,
440,572; New Brunswick, 321,233; Prince Edward Island, 108,891;
Quebec, 1,359,027; Ontario, 1,923,228; Manitoba, 65,954; the
North West, 56,446; British Columbia, 49,459.&nbsp; These figures
must be much added to if we would get an idea of the growth of
population, especially in the North West, which has increased by
leaps and bounds.&nbsp; Up to 1870 <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>it was as it had been since the
charter of Charles II.&mdash;the happy hunting-ground of the
Hudson Bay Company.&nbsp; As late as 1870 it had no railway
communication, no towns or villages, few post-offices, and no
telegraph.&nbsp; There must be a million of people settled there
by this time, and yet it is a wilderness almost untrod by
man.&nbsp; The origins of the populations are returned as
follows: 891,248 English and Welsh; 957,408 Irish; 699,863
Scotch; 1,298,929 French; 254,319 Germans.&nbsp; The balance is
made up of Dutch, Scandinavians, and Italians.&nbsp; A large
number of persons who were born in the United States are to be
found in Canada&mdash;and why not?&nbsp; They have in Canada a
government quite as free as in the United States, though the
Canadians prefer to have a holiday on the Queen&rsquo;s birthday
rather than the 4th of July, and an English Viceroy&mdash;who at
any rate is a gentleman&mdash;to an American President.&nbsp;
Anywhere in Canada the Englishman <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>is at home.&nbsp; The people have an
English look.&nbsp; Directly you pass the border into the States
you see the difference.&nbsp; There is an astonishing contrast
between the healthy Canadian and the lean and yellow Yankee.</p>
<p>Canadian history is one record of toil and struggle&mdash;of
the advance of the whites, of the retreat of the native
races.&nbsp; Foremost in suffering were the French.&nbsp; In 1608
the first permanent settlement in Canada was made by Champlain,
who founded Quebec, and afterwards discovered the lake which
still bears his name.&nbsp; It was he who taught the Iroquois to
stand in awe of gunpowder; but, alas! familiarity bred contempt,
and the Red Indian was more than once on the point of
exterminating the white man.&nbsp; It was only by the
intercession of the Saints that the feeble colony was
preserved.&nbsp; At Montreal, for instance, the advanced guard of
the settlements, some two hundred Iroquois fell upon twenty-six
Frenchmen.&nbsp; The Christians were out-matched <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>eight to one,
but, says the Chronicle, &lsquo;the Queen of Heaven was on their
side, and the Son of Mary refuses nothing to His holy
Mother.&nbsp; Through her intercession the Iroquois shot so
wildly, that at their first fire every bullet missed its mark,
and they met with a bloody defeat.&rsquo;&nbsp; No wonder the
French were animated with renewed zeal.&nbsp; Father Le Mercier
writes: &lsquo;On the day of Visitation of the Holy Virgin, the
chief Aontarisati, so regretted by the Iroquois, was taken
prisoner by our Indians, instructed by our fathers, and baptized;
and on the same day, being put to death, I doubt not he thanked
the Virgin for his misfortune and the blessing that followed, and
he prayed to God for his countrymen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was no common faith that led the French monks to seek to
make Canada theirs.&nbsp; Their sufferings from cold, from
starvation, from the savages, from want of all the comforts of
life, seem to have been as much as mortal <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>men could
bear.&nbsp; But they made many converts.&nbsp; On one occasion,
when the French Chaumont had delivered an address, his Indian
auditors declared that if he had spoken all day they should not
have had enough of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Dutch,&rsquo; said they,
&lsquo;have neither brains nor tongues; they never tell us about
paradise or hell.&nbsp; On the contrary, they lead us into bad
ways.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing could daunt the Jesuits&mdash;not the
loss of all they had, nor protracted suffering, nor cruel
death.&nbsp; &lsquo;The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the
Church,&rsquo; said one of them; &lsquo;and if we die by the
fires of the Iroquois, we shall have won eternal life by
snatching souls from the fires of hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let us listen to Chaumont again, as he stands before his
savage hearers&mdash;he and his companions having first, with
clasped hands, sung the &lsquo;Veni Creator&rsquo;: &lsquo;It is
not trade that brings us here.&nbsp; Do you think that your
beaver-skins can pay us for all our toil and <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>dangers?&nbsp; Keep them, if you like; or, if any fall
into our hands, we shall use them only for your service.&nbsp; We
seek not the things that perish.&nbsp; It is for the faith that
we have left our homes, to live in your hovels of bark and eat
food which the beasts of our country would scarcely touch.&nbsp;
We are the messengers whom God has sent to tell you that His Son
became a man for the love of you; that this man, the Son of God,
is the Prince and Master of men; that He has prepared in heaven
eternal joys for those who obey Him, and kindled the fires of
hell for those who will not receive His Word.&nbsp; If you reject
it, whoever you are&mdash;Onondaga, Seneca, Mohawk, Cayuga, or
Oneida&mdash;know that Jesus Christ, who inspires my heart and my
voice, will one day plunge you into hell.&nbsp; Be not the
authors of your own destruction.&nbsp; Accept the truth; listen
to the voice of the Omnipotent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wonderful miracles sustained and renewed <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>this ardent
faith.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1657, there was a truce with the
Iroquois, under cover of which three or four of them came to the
Montreal settlement.&nbsp; Nicholas God&eacute; and Jean
Pi&egrave;re were on the roof of their house, laying thatch, when
one of his visitors aimed his arquebuse at Saint Pi&egrave;re,
and brought him to the ground like a wild turkey from a
tree.&nbsp; The assassins, having cut off his head and carried it
home to their village, were amazed to hear it speak to them in
good Iroquois, scold them for their perfidy, and threaten them
with the vengeance of heaven; and we are told they continued to
hear its voice of admonition even after scalping it and throwing
away the skull.</p>
<p>During a great part of this period, the French population was
less than three thousand.&nbsp; How was it they were not
destroyed?&nbsp; Mr. Parkman tells us for two reasons.&nbsp; In
the first place, the settlements were grouped around three
fortified posts&mdash;Quebec, Three <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Rivers, and Montreal&mdash;which, in
time of danger, gave an asylum to the fugitive inhabitants; and
secondly, their assailants were distracted by other wars.&nbsp;
It was their aim to balance the rival settlements of the Hudson
and the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; It was well for Canada when France
lost hold of her.&nbsp; In 1666, Louis the Great handed her over,
bound hand and foot, to a company of merchants&mdash;the Company
of the West, as it was called.&nbsp; As, according to the edict,
the chief object in view was the glory of God, the Company was
required to supply its possessions with a sufficient number of
priests, and diligently exclude all teachers of false
doctrine.&nbsp; It was empowered to build forts and war-ships,
cast cannon, wage war, make peace, establish courts, appoint
judges, and otherwise to act as sovereign within its own
dominions.&nbsp; A monopoly of trade was granted it for forty
years, and Canada was the chief sufferer; but at any rate the
peopling of <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Canada was due to the king.&nbsp; Colbert did the work
and the king paid for it.&nbsp; Protestants were objected
to.&nbsp; Girls, to be wives to the emigrants, were sent out from
Dieppe and Rochelle.&nbsp; In time, girls of indifferent virtue,
under the care of duennas, emigrated to meet the growing demand
for wives.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am told,&rsquo; writes La Houtan,
&lsquo;that the plumpest were taken first, because it was
thought, being less active, they were more likely to keep at
home, and that they could resist the winter cold still
better.&rsquo;&nbsp; Further, such was the paternal care of the
king for Canada, that he attempted to found a colonial noblesse,
and offered bounties for children.&nbsp; The noblesse were a
doubtful boon: industrious peasants were much more to be
desired.&nbsp; Leading lazy lives, many of the gentilhommes soon
drifted into the direst poverty.&nbsp; The Canadians had one
advantage&mdash;their morals were well looked after by the
priests, who kindly took charge of their education as well.&nbsp;
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Compared
with the New England man, the habitant had very much the
advantage.&nbsp; He was a skilful woodsman, able to steer his
canoe, a soldier and a hunter.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when
Wolfe&rsquo;s army had scaled the heights of Abraham, and won
Canada for the British, it was the beginning of a new life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;England,&rsquo; writes Mr. Parkman, &lsquo;imposed by
the sword on reluctant Canada the boon of rational and ordered
liberty.&nbsp; A happier calamity never befell a people than the
conquest of Canada by the British arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was
not till the American Revolution had broken out, and the
royalists left the States to found in Canada a strong colony
attached to the British Crown, that Canada may be really said to
have been a part and parcel of the Empire, bone of our bone and
flesh of our flesh.&nbsp; It was necessary to move many of the
French Canadians elsewhere; and those who remained, still for
long looked with an unfriendly eye on England and her rule.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">OFF WITH THE EMIGRANTS&mdash;THE VOYAGE
OUT&mdash;THE &lsquo;SARNIA&rsquo; THE COD-FISHERY.</p>
<p>One Wednesday at the end of April, last year, St. Pancras
Railway Station was the scene of a display not often matched even
in these demonstrative days.&nbsp; Mr. J. J. Jones, of the
Samaritan Mission, had arranged to take out a party of five
hundred emigrants to Canada&mdash;the first party of the
season.&nbsp; The event seemed to create no little excitement in
philanthropic circles.&nbsp; The Lord Mayor had promised to be
there, but he was detained in the City, possibly in defence of
the ancient Corporation of which he has become the champion; but
he sent a cordial letter, as did <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>many other distinguished people, to
express sympathy and goodwill.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Lord Mayor, the Earl of Shaftesbury,
after the emigrants had been got together in a waiting-room,
presided at a farewell meeting, which ought to have sent the
emigrants in the best of spirits to the new homes they expect to
find on the other side of the Atlantic.&nbsp; They would, said
his lordship, still be under the reign of our Queen.&nbsp; They
would confer a great blessing on the country whither they were
going, and they would show what they could do as good citizens in
subduing and replenishing the earth, and in spreading over the
world the Anglo-Saxon race.&nbsp; He hoped that the young men
present would come back to England for wives, and ended with his
best wishes for all in the way of a safe voyage and temporal and
spiritual good.</p>
<p>The Earl of Carnarvon, who next spoke, had this advantage over
the noble chairman, <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>in that he had made a trip to Canada himself.&nbsp; The
emigrants, he said, would encounter difficulties.&nbsp; They were
not going to a paradise, but they would find that they had a
better chance of getting a living in the New World; especially if
they avoided bad company and the crowded towns, and got into the
country, and underwent a certain preparatory training.&nbsp; As
to Canada, it was a country in which a man would succeed who had
health and strength and industry, and a good head and a good
heart, and the fear of God to teach him that honesty was the best
policy.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Tyler, M.P., the chairman of the Grand Trunk
Railway, followed in a similar strain.&nbsp; The people were not
crowded up in Canada as they were here.&nbsp; It was a grand
country for honest, hard-working men and well-behaved women; but
he recommended them at first to seek good honest people to work
with, rather than high wages.&nbsp; <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Turning to the young women, he
assured them they would find good husbands in Canada&mdash;a
remark which seemed to give them much satisfaction; and he hoped
that they would have large families when they married, as large
families were a blessing out there.</p>
<p>Then came forward Mr. Clare Sewell Read, M.P., who, as a
countryman, said he saw some country bumpkins in the party, and
he could assure them, as he had been in Canada, its soil was
unrivalled for fertility.</p>
<p>Lord Napier of Magdala followed, and then came the Hon. Donald
A. Smith, one of the directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
to tell how people prospered in Canada who behaved well and
worked hard.&nbsp; The Rev. Oswald Dykes and the Rev. Burman
Cassin also addressed the audience; and there were others, such
as the Earl of Aberdeen, the Rev. W. Tyler, and the Rev. Styleman
Herring, who were ready to say a few words <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>had time
permitted; but the train had to be packed up with passengers and
luggage, and there was no time to spare.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were off, amidst tears and cheers, while
Mr. Jones and I, with Mr. Alexander Begg, of the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and the remainder of the emigrants, followed.&nbsp; A
little after five we arrived at Liverpool, and then Mr. Jones had
to work like a horse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I, with a couple of artistic friends, who are to
sketch us, all took our ease in our inn, from which comfortable
quarters I felt sadly indisposed to stir; but I had to see the
emigrants off, and my heart sank into my shoes as, looking at the
hundreds swarming the platform, and the pyramids of luggage, and
then at the <i>Sarnia</i> moored in mid-stream, the thought
suggested itself, How on earth can they all be stowed
away?&mdash;a query which, however, was soon settled, as, at a
later hour, I found myself on <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>board the <i>Sarnia</i>, leaving
smoky Liverpool behind, and with the ship&rsquo;s head turned to
the sunset &lsquo;and the baths of all the Western
stars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Sarnia</i>, it may be as well to inform my readers, is
one of the screw-steamers running between Quebec and Liverpool,
by the Dominion Line, which line commenced its gay career in
1870.&nbsp; I ought to be very happy on board, since I learn,
from the attentive perusal of documents lying in the cabin, that,
owing to the lines in the model, the rolling of the ship is to a
great extent, not destroyed, but reduced, making a considerable
decrease in sea-sickness, and that in the book of rules and
regulations compiled for the guidance of the Dominion Line
officers, they must run no risk which might by any possibility
result in accident to the ship, and that they are further
requested to bear in mind that the safety of the lives and
property entrusted to their care is the ruling principle that
should <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>govern them in the management of their ships.&nbsp; I
almost fancy I must have thrown away my money in insuring my life
against loss and my person against accidents.&nbsp; What have I
to fear, if the rules and regulations of the company be
observed?&nbsp; I am very glad, as it is, I did not insure for a
larger sum, though the agent, who, of course, had his eye on the
extra commission, was kind enough to suggest it were well to
insure for the larger sum, <i>in case the ship went
down</i>!&mdash;a thing not to be dreamed of.</p>
<p>I have consulted that oracle of our fathers&mdash;Francis
Moore.&nbsp; In his &lsquo;Vox Stellarum&rsquo; he tells me, to
my comfort and satisfaction, that after the 25th of April the
winds will be light.&nbsp; Francis Moore, you may tell me, is not
weatherwise.&nbsp; Are the scientific meteorologists, with their
forecasts, wiser?&nbsp; It is hard to say.</p>
<p>It is a comfort to think that the emigrants are well off for
literature.&nbsp; The <i>Graphic</i> <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>company&mdash;whose last dividend, I
learn, was a good deal over a hundred per cent.&mdash;have sent a
tremendous packet of <i>Graphics</i>.&nbsp; The Bible Society
sent Testaments.&nbsp; The Religious Tract Society have placed at
Mr. Jones&rsquo;s disposal tracts and books.&nbsp; The Rev.
Newman Hall has sent 250 books, while a goodly packet of the
&lsquo;Family Circle Edition&rsquo; of the <i>Christian World</i>
will, I dare say, be in much request&mdash;quite as much as the
five hundred sheets of hymns which the Earl of Aberdeen brought
with him on Wednesday to St. Pancras as his contribution to the
common stock.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, as my Welsh friends would say,
the lines for us are cast in pleasant places, and we have a
goodly heritage.&nbsp; It is to be hoped it may be so.</p>
<p>I never saw a more tidy lot of emigrants&mdash;some of them
evidently the right class to get on.&nbsp; I had an amusing chat
with one, who told me what inquiries he had made before he would
entrust Mr. J. J. Jones with &lsquo;C&aelig;sar <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and his
fortunes.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the emigrants are all like him, the
Yankees, if there be such in Canada, will find it rather
difficult to take them in.&nbsp; We swarm with children and
babies.&nbsp; I fear some of us will wish, before we reach the
St. Lawrence, that good King Herod was on board.&nbsp; Of course,
these are not my sentiments.&nbsp; I suppose most of us were
babies once&mdash;there is every reason to believe that I was;
nevertheless, the most gushing mother will admit that there are
times when even the sweetest of babes ceases to charm.&nbsp; My
companions in the smoking-room the first night were, however, by
no means babes.&nbsp; I had not been there half-an-hour before I
was offered 34,000 acres of land&mdash;abounding with fish and
game, and all that the carnal heart could desire&mdash;a decided
bargain.&nbsp; I did not close with the offer.&nbsp; Perhaps I
ought to have done so.&nbsp; But such earthly grandeur is beyond
my dreams.</p>
<p>Nothing can be drearier or more monotonous <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>than a trip
to Canada in the early season of the year.&nbsp; After you leave
Ireland, you see no ships&mdash;nothing but the sea, grey and
dull as the heaven above.&nbsp; Now and then a whale comes up to
blow, and that is all; and when the wind blows hard, you get
nothing but big, lumpy waves, which set the ship rolling, and add
only to the discomforts.&nbsp; And then you are on the
Newfoundland banks, where you may spend dull days and duller
nights&mdash;now going at half-speed, now stopping altogether,
while the fog-horn blows dismally every few minutes, and whence
you can see scarcely the length of the ship ahead.</p>
<p>Like Oscar Wilde, I own that I am very much disappointed with
the Atlantic.&nbsp; The icebergs are monotonous&mdash;when you
have seen one, that is enough.&nbsp; In the saloon, we are a sad,
dull party; even in the smoking-room, one can scarcely get up a
decent laugh.&nbsp; I pity the poor emigrants in the steerage,
whom a clever young Irish <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>journalist on board, with the
instinct of his race, has failed to excite into a proper state of
indignation on account of the discomforts of the voyage, and the
hardness of the potatoes&mdash;always a matter of complaint in
all the ships that I have ever been on board of.</p>
<p>The raw, cold, damp fog has taken all the starch out of the
steerage passengers, always the first to grumble on sea, as they
are on shore; yet on one occasion they did go so far as to send a
deputation to the captain, and what, think you, was their
grievance?&mdash;that they had no sauce to their fish!&mdash;a
grievance of little account, when one thinks of the sauce we had
served up in the saloon.</p>
<p>As a rule, the steerage passengers are a difficult body to
deal with; they seem so helpless, and require so much looking
after.&nbsp; Mr. Jones has enough to do to look after his.&nbsp;
If they lose anything, however paltry, he is appealed to.&nbsp;
If they require anything not provided in the bill of fare, he is
sent for.&nbsp; It <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>is very clear to me that his party have great
advantages.&nbsp; He has taken down all their occupations, and
when we arrive at Quebec they will all, if possible, be provided
with employment, and will be at once forwarded to their
destination, without loss of time or expenditure of cash.&nbsp;
Many of them are also assisted by his Society with small sums of
money, and in every way they are helped as few other emigrants
are.</p>
<p>We have on board a party of fifty-one lads, sent out by Dr.
Bowman Stephenson, who has a dep&ocirc;t somewhere near Hamilton,
and a helper is on board to take care of them.&nbsp; Some of them
are of very juvenile years, and, it is to be believed, in Canada
will find a far more favourable lot than they ever could in the
streets and slums of the East End.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; said I to one of them
the other morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, sir, I am going to be adopted,&rsquo; was the
reply; and adopted he will be by <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>some worthy couple who, having no
children of their own, are ready to give the little outcast a
home such as he never could have found in the old country.</p>
<p>We have also an agent on board, who, for a certain sum, agrees
to take young fellows out and to find them suitable
situations.&nbsp; That is a course I should not recommend.&nbsp;
A young fellow had far better keep that extra cash in his pocket,
get out as far into the North-west as he can, there hire himself
to some settler, who at this time of year is sure to be in need
of his services, and then in a year or two he will be able to get
a grant of land on his own account, on which, after three years
of real hard work, he will be able to live in peace and comfort,
and to achieve an independence of which he has no chance on our
side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>It quite grieves me to think of the poor farmers I have known
at home, wasting their time and capital and strength in a
hopeless <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>effort to make both ends meet, who might be doing well
out here, with the certainty that their families will be left in
a comfortable position as far as this world&rsquo;s goods are
concerned.&nbsp; One thing, however, I must strongly impress upon
the emigrant, and that is, the necessity of coming out in the
spring.</p>
<p>It is madness to cross the Atlantic in the autumn; when he
lands at Quebec, he will find nothing to do, and must live on his
capital, or starve till next spring; and if I might recommend a
ship, it certainly would be the <i>Sarnia</i>, on which I now
write.&nbsp; She is slow but sure.&nbsp; Her commander, Captain
Gibson, is all that a captain should be&mdash;not a brilliant
conversationalist, not one of those men who set the table in a
roar; but cautious, skilful, fully alive to the responsibilities
of his position and the dangers of his calling.&nbsp; As to the
dangers, it is impossible to exaggerate them.&nbsp; There are
more than a thousand of us on board, and were anything to happen,
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>not more
than three hundred of us could, I should think, be crowded into
the boats, provided that the sea were quite calm, and that we had
plenty of time to leave the ship; and in a panic and in bad
weather, it is clear that even such boats as the <i>Sarnia</i> is
supplied with would be of little avail.&nbsp; Safety seems to me
a mere matter of chance.&nbsp; You hit on an iceberg, and down
goes the ship with all on board, leaving no record behind.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I believe these big steamers often, on a
dark night, run down the vessels engaged in fishing off the
Newfoundland banks.&nbsp; When we passed, the season had scarcely
commenced.&nbsp; It is in May, towards the end of the month, that
the fishing commences.&nbsp; The chief fishermen are the French,
who mostly hail from St. Malo, and who have in the Gulf of
Newfoundland two small islands, which they use for
fish-curing.&nbsp; You get an idea of the extent of these
fisheries, when I tell you that the total <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>value of them
amounts to three millions a year, and that the supply seems
inexhaustible.&nbsp; Romanists and High Churchmen who indulge in
salt cod in Lent have little cause to fear that that aid to true
religion will cease&mdash;at any rate, in our time.&nbsp; The
fishing season lasts until November, when the shoals pass on to
their winter quarters in deeper waters.</p>
<p>The delicate and the consumptive have many reasons for
thankfulness in connection with this fishery.&nbsp; What they
would do without the cod-liver oil, which has saved and
lengthened many a valuable life, it were hard to say.&nbsp; It is
to England that almost all the cod-liver oil comes.&nbsp; The cod
roe, pickled and barrelled, is exported almost entirely to
France, where it is in great demand, as ground-bait for the
sardine fishery.&nbsp; How great that demand is, the reader will
at once perceive when I tell him that no fewer than 13,000 boats
on the coast of Brittany are engaged in the sardine fishery
alone.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>I ought
to say that these Quebec steamers are, as regards saloon
accommodation, and the class of people you meet with on board,
not quite on a par with those which ply between Liverpool and New
York.&nbsp; Perhaps the latter are fitted up almost too
splendidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the stormy winds do
blow&rsquo;&mdash;when everyone is ill&mdash;when you are in that
happy state of mind when man delights you not, or woman
either&mdash;the gilded saloons, the velvet cushions, the plate
glass and ornamented panels, seem quite out of place; to say
nothing of the luxurious dinners, which not everyone is able to
enjoy.&nbsp; Such things are better fitted for summer seas and
summer skies.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">ARRIVAL AT QUEBEC.</p>
<p>Once more I am on <i>terra firma</i>, and on Canadian soil,
where I breathe a balmier air and rejoice in a clearer atmosphere
than you in England can have any idea of.&nbsp; After all, we
were in twenty-four hours before the mail steamer, the
<i>Sarmatian</i>, which you must own is a feather in the cap of
the <i>Sarnia</i>.&nbsp; One hears much of the St. Lawrence, but
it is hard to exaggerate its beauties.&nbsp; When you are fairly
in it, after having escaped the fog of the Newfoundland Banks and
the icebergs of the Gulf, on you sail all day and night amidst
islands, and past mountains, their tops covered with snow,
stretching far away into the interior, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>guarding lands yet waiting to be
tilled, and primeval forests yet ignorant of the
woodcutter&rsquo;s axe.&nbsp; A hardy people, mostly of French
extraction, inhabit that part of the province of Quebec; but as
you reach nearer to the capital, the land becomes flatter, and
the signs of human settlement more frequent in the shape of
wooden houses, each with its plot of ground, where the rustics
carry on the daily work of the farm, or in the shape of villages,
inhabited by ship-wrecked fishermen, who have intermarried with
the French, and whose children, if they bear the commonest of
English names, are at the same time utterly ignorant, not only of
the tongue that Shakespeare spake, but of the faith and morals
Milton held.&nbsp; They are a lazy people, living chiefly on the
harvest of the sea, and doing little when that harvest is
over.&nbsp; Men are wanted to cut down timber, and they come in
gangs of two or three hundred, and spend a week in riotous
debauchery before they can <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>be got to work.&nbsp; Few English
settlers go into that region, yet they can easily make a living
there if they are inclined to rough it in the bush, and are not
afraid of coarse living and hard work.&nbsp; Villages, churches,
hotels, are all built of wood on a stone foundation, and, painted
as the houses are, they remind one not a little of Zaandam, and
the little wooden cottages you may see in that old quarter of the
world.&nbsp; But the original colonists are a poor people, living
frugally and with little desire for the comforts and luxuries of
life.&nbsp; It is the same in Quebec, where the poor all talk
French, and where the Protestants are in a very small
minority.&nbsp; In Quebec there is little to attract the
stranger.&nbsp; It looks its best at it stands on its picturesque
rock rising out of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; You see the French
University, founded as far back as 1663 by that De Laval whose
name is so deeply interwoven with the French history of the
province.&nbsp; It is thus that his contemporaries <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>describe
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;He began,&rsquo; writes Mother Juchiereau de
Saint Denis, Superior of the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, &lsquo;in his
tenderest years the study of perfection, and we have reason to
believe he reached it, since every virtue which St. Paul demands
in a bishop was seen and admired in him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mother
Marie, Superior of the Ursulines, wrote: &lsquo;I will not say
that he is a saint, but I may say with truth that he lives like a
saint and an apostle.&nbsp; We have ample evidence of the
austerity of his life.&nbsp; His servant, a lay-brother,
testified after his death that he slept on a hard bed, and would
not suffer it to be changed, even when it became full of
fleas.&nbsp; So great was his charity that he gave fifteen
hundred or two thousand francs to the poor every
year.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have seen him,&rsquo; writes
Houssart, &lsquo;keep cooked meat five or six, seven or eight
days, in the heat of summer, and when it was all mouldy and
wormy, he washed it in warm water, and ate it, and told me it was
very <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>good.&nbsp; I determined to keep everything I could that
had belonged to his holy person, and after his death to soak bits
of linen in his blood when his body was opened, and take a few
bones and cartilages from his breast, cut off his hair, and keep
his clothes and such things to serve as most precious
relics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then you see the spire of the English Cathedral, a very plain
building, and higher up still, the modern Parliament House, but
recently erected.&nbsp; Further on, you see the Dufferin
Promenade, which is a lasting record to the most popular of
English Governors-General; and higher up still is the citadel,
and beyond that are the plains of Abraham, where Wolfe fell in
the hour of victory.</p>
<p>The Presbyterians and Wesleyans have good congregations, but
the Baptists are not strong, in spite of the wonderful vitality
of the aged pastor, Mr. Marsh, who, octogenarian as he is, seemed
much more able to climb the <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>heights than the writer, who perhaps
was a little out of condition on account of the laziness of sea
life.&nbsp; One of the buildings with which I was most pleased
was that of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association (built
partly by the munificence of Mr. George Williams, of London, the
founder of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Associations all the
world over), which is quite a credit to the place, and from the
top of which you get a magnificent view of the quaint old city,
with its gates and narrow streets, and the pleasant suburbs, and
the far-away plains and hills, amongst which the St. Lawrence or
the river Charles, which runs into it here, urges on its wild
career.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a city where we have to contend,&rsquo; says the
last Report of the Association, &lsquo;against great
disadvantages, where the Protestant population seems to be
gradually diminishing, and the young men seeking other fields of
enterprise, it is a matter of sincere thankfulness <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that we have
not to record a retrograde movement.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was with
regret that I saw that the Independent church, which is a fine
one, has had to close its doors.&nbsp; Another disadvantage
resulting from this decay of Protestantism is, that the
Protestants have to bear more than their fair share of taxation,
as the Roman Catholic churches and convents and nunneries, which
are wealthy, are exempt from taxation altogether.&nbsp; I fancy,
also, that the men employed at the extensive wharves are doing
all they can to drive the trade away, as they impose such
regulations as to the number of men to be employed in loading or
unloading ships, that now many of them load lower down the
river.&nbsp; However, the place is busy enough, especially on the
other side of the river, where the steamers land their
passengers, and where Miss Richardson has established a
comfortable home for girls and young women&mdash;which I
inspected&mdash;free of expense, as they arrive from England, and
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>seeks to
plant them out where their services may be required.</p>

</a></p>
<p>One of our latest lady writers is very enthusiastic on the
subject of Quebec.&nbsp; I am sorry to say I cannot share in that
enthusiasm, and I was by no means disconsolate that I could not
stay to attend a convivial meeting to which I was invited by a
French colonist, one of our fellow-passengers.&nbsp; I was soon
tired of its dusty and narrows streets, and its pavements all
made of boards, and its priests and nuns.&nbsp; There are no
shops to look at worth speaking of, and the idea of riding in one
of the <i>caleches</i> was quite out of the question.&nbsp;
Nothing more rickety in the shape of a riding machine was ever
invented.&nbsp; It seemed to me that they were sure to turn over
as soon as you turned the corner.&nbsp; The <i>caleche</i> is
simply a little sledge on wheels.&nbsp; As a sledge I fancy it is
delightful, though by no means up to the sledges I have driven on
the Elbe in hard winters in days long long <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>departed; but
as a carriage, drawn by a broken-down horse, with a driver almost
as wild as the original Indian, the <i>caleche</i>, I own, finds
little favour in my eyes.&nbsp; Up the town there does not seem
much life.&nbsp; There is plenty of it, however, in the shipping
district, where a great deal of building is going on.</p>
<p>Of one thing I must complain in connection with emigration,
and that is the pity the emigrants land at Quebec at all.&nbsp;
The steamers all go up to Montreal after they have shot down
their helpless crowd of emigrants on the wharf, where they have
to spend a dreary day waiting to get their luggage.&nbsp; How
much more pleasant it would be to take them right on to Montreal,
which, at any rate, is the destination of ninety-nine out of a
hundred at the very least.&nbsp; As it is, they are taken on by a
special train, which starts no one knows when, and which arrives
at Montreal at what hour it suits the railway authorities.&nbsp;
In that <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>respect, it seems to me, there is room for great
improvement; but on this head I speak diffidently, as, perhaps,
the steamship owners and the railway companies know their own
business better than I do.&nbsp; The trip is a picturesque one,
and can be enjoyed in these short nights better on the deck of a
steamer than in a railway-car.&nbsp; [I am glad to hear since
writing the above that this state of things will not further
exist, and that every arrangement is now being made by the
Canadian Pacific Railway authorities for the speedy transfer from
the steamer to the train.]&nbsp; The more I see of matters, the
clearer it seems to me that large parties of emigrants should not
be sent out by themselves, but that they should be under the care
of some one who knows the country and the railway officials.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say, as regards some of the better class of
emigrants, the long delay at Quebec gave them an opportunity of
getting drunk, of which they seemed gladly to have <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>availed
themselves.&nbsp; The future of some of these young fellows it is
not difficult to predict.&nbsp; In a little while they will have
exhausted their resources, and will return home disgusted with
Canada, and swearing that it is impossible to get a living
there.&nbsp; There was no need for them to go to an hotel at
all.&nbsp; In the yard there was a capital shed fitted up for
refreshments.&nbsp; I had there a plate of good ham,
bread-and-butter and jam, and as much good tea as I
wanted&mdash;all for a shilling.&nbsp; It was a boon indeed to
the emigrants we had landed from the <i>Sarnia</i> to find such a
place at their disposal.</p>
<p>As to myself, I need not assure you I was glad enough to find
myself in a Pullman car, bound for Montreal.&nbsp; I shed no
tears as we left Quebec far behind, and glided on under a
cloudless, moonlit sky, serenaded by those Canadian nightingales,
the frogs.&nbsp; At first I felt a little difficulty in retiring
to rest.&nbsp; As a modest man, I was inclined to object to the
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>presence
of so many ladies, although we had been on the best of terms
during our voyage out.&nbsp; It is true that they had their
husbands with them, but nevertheless I felt uncomfortable, and
vowed I would retreat to the smoking-room.&nbsp; However, I was
over-persuaded, and lay down with the rest; though more than once
that eventful night I was awoke by awful sounds, reminding me
rather of the hoarse roar of the Atlantic in a storm than of the
peaceful slumbers of a Pullman car.</p>

45</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">AT MONTREAL, AND ON TO
OTTAWA&mdash;INTERVIEWING AND INTERVIEWED.</p>
<p>One discovery I have made since I have been here is that
Canada has its clouded skies and its rainy days, and that a
Canadian spring may be quite as ungenial as an English one.&nbsp;
Yet it is, I still see, the country for a working man.&nbsp; And
I write this in full knowledge of the fact that here at Montreal
the charitable, on whom the poor depend&mdash;for there is no
poor-law in this country, and let us hope, seeing what mischief
has been done by poor-laws, there may never be one&mdash;have
been sorely exercised this winter how to feed the hungry, and to
clothe the naked, and to find <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the outcast a home.&nbsp; But, mind
you, I only recommend the place for the poor agricultural
labourer or artisan; and already I find the larger portion of
such who have come out with me are in full work, and are thankful
that they have come, but they had to take anything that was
offered.&nbsp; It is clear this is not the country for clerks and
shop-lads, and the secretary of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association&mdash;which I find here to be a flourishing
institution&mdash;writes:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young men are coming by each steamer.&nbsp; Many of
them are introduced to us with excellent recommendations, and
have occupied good positions in England.&nbsp; Some have left
their situations on the representation of railway and steamboat
agents as to the opportunities in this country.&nbsp; We find it
absolutely impossible to secure employment for them in many
cases, business in every department has been so dull.&nbsp;
Almost all the houses have been employing hands that they <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>could
dispense with.&nbsp; Reports from the West show the market
glutted as bad as in Montreal.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I fear things
have not improved since.</p>
<p>It is cruel to get such young men out of England.&nbsp; They
are worse off here than they would be at home.&nbsp; It is
curious to note, in connection with emigration, the evident
desire of the educated mechanic to keep his rivals out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By all means bid them stop at home,&rsquo; he cries,
&lsquo;or wages will be lower in the colonies.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Already I have been interviewed by a working-class official here,
and that is his cry.&nbsp; And I give it for what it may be
worth, merely remarking that such illustrations as he gave in
support of his views turned out to be the merest moonshine.</p>

"Junction of the River Ottawa and St. Lawrence, Montreal"

</a></p>
<p>Now let me speak of Montreal, which I entered with pleasure,
and leave with regret.&nbsp; It is the chief city of Canada, and
is built on the northern bank of the St. Lawrence, <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>where the
muddy Ottawa, after a course of 600 miles, debouches into
it.&nbsp; You arrive by a grand railway bridge, which is one of
the wonders of this part of the world.&nbsp; The population is
nearly 200,000, of which two-thirds are French or Irish, and
Roman Catholic.&nbsp; It abounds with every sign of prosperity,
and, as a city, would be a credit to the old country.&nbsp; The
river front is lined with steamers loading for England.&nbsp; The
principal thoroughfares contain lofty buildings, and shops as
spacious as any of our best, whilst its hotels altogether throw
ours into the shade; and then, in the suburbs the merchants live
in palaces, whilst handsome churches attest the wealth, if not
the piety, of all classes of the population.&nbsp; I fear Mammon
worship is the prevailing form of idolatry, yet I cannot shut my
eyes to the fact that the early settlement of the place was the
result of religious enthusiasm, and that it was an attempt to
found in America <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>a veritable kingdom of God as understood by the Roman
Catholics; but all that is past, and the chief topics of interest
are the prices of pork, or the state of the market as regards
butter and cheese.&nbsp; Let me remind you that such is the
goodness of the cheese of Canada, all made in factories, that
nearly as much cheese finds its way into the English market from
Montreal as from New York.</p>
<p>One thing especially strikes me, and that is the muscular
character of the young men.&nbsp; Montreal is a great place for
athletes.&nbsp; Montreal has hundreds of such, as it is not only
a centre of commerce, but the most important manufacturing city
in the Dominion&mdash;3,000 hands are employed in the manufacture
of boots and shoes.&nbsp; Then there are here the largest sugar
refineries and cotton mills and silk and cloth factories in
Canada, and the result is that, as these factories are nursed by
Protection, the towns are unnaturally crowded, and the people all
over <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the
country have to pay high prices for inferior articles, and the
Canadians, who ought to be making cheese and butter, and growing
corn for the artisans of Lancashire, are doing all they can to
reduce their best and most natural customers to a state of
starvation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a shame,&rsquo; said a Canadian
manufacturer to me, only in language a little more emphatic,
&lsquo;that England allows any of her colonies to put prohibitory
duties on British products.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I quite agree with
my friend that it is a shame.&nbsp; However, as long as the
present Canadian Government are in power, there is no chance of
Free Trade.&nbsp; It was the Protection cry that placed the
Conservatives in power.&nbsp; With so many French as there are in
Canada, vainly dreaming of a restoration of French rule, it is
idle to talk of the interests of the mother country.&nbsp; Nor
does Great Britain deserve very well of the Canadians.&nbsp; Up
to almost the present time it has held them <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>to be of
little account, and, as we all know, it is not so very long since
it suffered Brother Jonathan to annex that part of Maine in which
Portland is situated, and thus to deprive Canada of its only
winter harbour.</p>
<p>For one thing Montreal is to be highly commended, and that is
on account of its hotels.&nbsp; The Windsor Hotel, in Dominion
Square, is one of the finest hotels in America, and as you enter
you are quite bewildered at the magnificence of the
entrance-hall.&nbsp; A curious thing happened to me there.&nbsp;
Mr. Hoyle and Mr. Barker, of the U.K. Alliance, had come there
after a pilgrimage in the States, and it was determined to give
them a reception.&nbsp; I had a ticket, and went for about an
hour, chatting pleasantly with readers, who had known me by
repute, and were glad to shake hands with me.&nbsp; Imagine my
horror when, in the next morning&rsquo;s paper, I read that the
reception had been got up by Temperance friends for me, as <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>well as
Messrs. Hoyle and Barker, and that my humble name figured first
on the list.&nbsp; Perhaps this was meant as a consolation to
me.&nbsp; I had been interviewed on the previous day, and the
papers had spoken of me in such complimentary terms that I felt
almost a lion.</p>
<p>Alas! in America interviewing is quite a common-place affair,
and it gives no <i>&eacute;clat</i> to be interviewed.&nbsp;
People sat smoking in the hall as I passed, utterly unconscious
of the fact.&nbsp; Yet the reporters did their best.&nbsp; One of
them called after I was gone to bed.&nbsp; He said he was not
going to be scooped out by the other fellow, whatever that may
mean.&nbsp; Virtue in his case was not rewarded.&nbsp; I kept to
my bed, and left the enterprising reporter to do the best he
could.</p>
<p>I ought to say a word of the hotel at which I
stopped&mdash;the Lawrence Hall, in James&rsquo;s
Street&mdash;which I strongly recommend to all, especially to
such of my friends as <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>may be contemplating a visit to
Montreal.&nbsp; The bedrooms are beautifully clean, the cooking
is excellent, and the service is admirable.&nbsp; It enjoys a
tremendous amount of support.&nbsp; I was there just forty-eight
hours, and I counted as many as two hundred names of arrivals
after me, and yet, in spite of the crowd, there was ample
accommodation for all, and I and my friends dined as comfortably
and quietly as if we had been at home.&nbsp; The proprietor, Mr.
Hogan, is a gentleman with whom it is a pleasure to
converse.&nbsp; Nor are his charges high.</p>
<p>It is a sight to sit in the hall and watch the ever-shifting
crowd, or to stray into the shaving apartment, where a dozen
barbers are always hard at work.&nbsp; I own I became a victim,
and paid a shilling for a performance which in London only costs
me sixpence; but in London I simply have my hair cut, here I was
under the care of a &lsquo;professional artist.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
quote his card: <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&lsquo;Physiognomical hairdresser, facial operator,
cranium manipulator, and capillary abridger.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could
not think of offering so distinguished a professor less than a
shilling.&nbsp; But the fact is, you can&rsquo;t travel cheaply
either in Canada or the United States.</p>
<p>It goes sadly against the grain to pay fivepence for having
one&rsquo;s boots blacked, and the way in which your change is
doled out to you is not pleasant, and adds materially to the
difficulties of the situation.&nbsp; For instance, I had a
certain American coin the other day pressed into my reluctant
hands on the express understanding that it was to go for ten
cents.&nbsp; I paid it to a ferryman, who said it was only worth
eight, and then, on that supposition, he managed to cheat me; and
I had to appeal to a friend of mine, who told me that I had not
the right change, before I could get the man to give me my due;
directly, however, the mistake was pointed out he rectified it,
thus acknowledging, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>in the most barefaced manner, his attempt to cheat; and
the beauty of it was, I was with a great man of the place, who
witnessed the whole transaction, and never said a word,
apparently looking upon it as a matter of course.</p>
<p>I fear there is a good deal of villainy in the world, and that
it is not confined to America.&nbsp; Travellers are bound to be
victimised, and the best thing you can do is to laugh.&nbsp; I
own I did so at Liverpool the other day, as I was waiting for the
tugboat to take me off to the <i>Sarnia</i>.&nbsp; I knew that I
had not made a mistake, I knew that the tug was sure to come; yet
four big hulking fellows with brazen faces would have made me
believe that I was too late for the tug, and that my only chance
of getting on board was for me to let them row me out.&nbsp; In
that case the attempt was the more rascally, as from a small
row-boat I could never have boarded the <i>Sarnia</i> had <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>I
tried.&nbsp; Yet there they stood&mdash;sullen and
expectant&mdash;for a quarter of an hour, taking me, possibly,
for a bigger fool even than I look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity,&rsquo; said a Canadian lady to me,
&lsquo;that Queen Victoria&rsquo;&mdash;for whom all Canada prays
that long may she reign over us, happy and
glorious&mdash;&lsquo;fixed upon Ottawa as the site of the
Government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am very much inclined to a similar feeling.&nbsp; At
Montreal the change of water affected me very disagreeably.&nbsp;
At Ottawa I was completely floored.&nbsp; It is a curious fact
that almost everyone who goes to Ottawa is taken ill.&nbsp; I was
complaining of my first terrible night to Sir Leonard Tilley, the
Finance Minister, and he said that when he first came to Ottawa
it was the same with him.</p>
<p>A lady told me that Lady Tupper, who has just left the Colony
for England, where, it is said, her lord and master hopes to find
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a seat in
the Imperial Parliament&mdash;a consummation devoutly to be
wished, as to my mind it is clear that all our colonies should
have representatives in Parliament&mdash;made a similar complaint
as to the effect of the place on her children, and I have it on
the best authority that scarcely a session passes but an M.P.
pays the penalty of a residence in Ottawa.</p>
<p>In my case I was preserved, as the man in the &lsquo;Arabian
Nights&rsquo; says, for the greater misfortunes yet to befall me
by the use of Dr. Browne&rsquo;s far-famed
&lsquo;Chlorodyne&rsquo;&mdash;an indispensable requisite, I am
bound to say, when an emigrant takes his trial trip to
Canada.&nbsp; I know not who is the inventor&mdash;I believe it
is what we call a patent medicine&mdash;that is, a medicine not
sanctioned by the faculty&mdash;but, as has been observed of the
Pickwick pen, it is indeed a boon and a blessing to men.&nbsp; I
used &lsquo;Chlorodyne,&rsquo; and was soon all right.&nbsp; Sir
Leonard <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Tilley told me he did the same, and no one should go to
Ottawa without having a small bottle of it in his carpet-bag.</p>
<p>Yet Ottawa is not without a certain freshness of beauty that
one associates <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> with perfect
health.&nbsp; The stately Government buildings, all of grey
stone, are placed on a hill, whence you have a peerless view of
river and country and distant hill, and far away forests all
around.&nbsp; A more picturesque site it would be assuredly most
difficult to find.&nbsp; As to the town itself, it is a curious
compound&mdash;almost Irish in that respect&mdash;of splendour
and meanness.&nbsp; There are magnificent shops&mdash;and then
you come to wooden shanties, which in such a city ought long ere
this to have been improved off the face of the earth.&nbsp; If on
a rainy day, unless very careful, you attempt to cross the
streets, you are in danger of sticking in the mud, which no one
seems to ever think of removing, and in many parts <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>there are
disgraceful holes in the plank pavement on which you walk, which
are dangerous, especially to the aged and infirm.</p>
<p>In Ottawa the contrasts are more violent than I have seen
elsewhere.&nbsp; Everyone comes to the place.&nbsp; It is the
headquarters of the Dominion.&nbsp; I met there statesmen,
adventurers, wild men of the woods, or prairie, deputies from
Manitoba, lawyers from Quebec, sharpers and honest men, all
staying at one hotel; and it seemed strange to sit at dinner and
see great rough fellows, with the manners of ploughmen, quaffing
their costly champagne, and fancying themselves patterns of
gentility and taste.&nbsp; In one thing they disappointed
me.&nbsp; Sir Charles Tupper was to leave for England, and his
admirers met outside the hotel to see him off.&nbsp; There was a
carriage and four to convey him to the station, and other
carriages followed.&nbsp; There was a military band in <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>attendance,
much to the disgust of the Opposition journals&mdash;and yet, in
spite of all, the cheers which followed the departing statesman
were so faint as to be perfectly ridiculous to a British ear, and
seemed quite out of proportion to all the display that had been
made.&nbsp; Certainly they seemed quite childish compared with
those which greeted a certain individual, whose name delicacy
forbids my mentioning, when, on the last night on board the
<i>Sarnia</i>, he ventured humbly to reply to the toast of the
Press which had been given in the smoking-room by a Quebec artist
returning home from study in Paris.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, certainly, there is no demand for emigrants, unless
it be good female servants, who are wanted much more, and can
have much more comfortable living, at home.&nbsp; A lady asked me
to send her a few good servants from England.&nbsp; I replied
that my wife wanted them as much as she did, and <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>that it was
my duty to attend to her requirements first.</p>
<p>It is curious the airs the raw servant-girls from Ireland give
themselves out here.&nbsp; One day, when I was at Peterborough,
one of the head-quarters of the lumber trade&mdash;which
yesterday was a dense forest, and is now a town of 8,000
people&mdash;I heard of the arrival of a lot of girls from
Galway.&nbsp; The drill-hall was set apart for their use, and
there they were respectfully waited on by the chief ladies of the
district in need of that rarest of created beings&mdash;a good
maid-of-all-work.&nbsp; In this particular case one of the
arrivals was fixed on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>The girl seemed uncertain on that point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you wash?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you cook?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you do housemaid&rsquo;s work?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Well,
she thought she could.</p>
<p>Then came the question of wages.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you take eight dollars a month?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, she would not.&nbsp; Would she accept of nine?&nbsp; Oh
no!&nbsp; Would she take ten?&nbsp; Certainly not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; said the lady, beginning to be
alarmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They told me I was to have twelve dollars a
month,&rsquo; said the girl, and that put a stop to the
negotiation.</p>
<p>When I state that an English sovereign is worth at this time
four dollars and eighty-six cents, I think you will agree with me
that this charming daughter of Erin somewhat overrated the value
of her services.&nbsp; The Canadians are a well-to-do people, but
they cannot afford twelve dollars a month for a mere
housemaid.&nbsp; I think it would be well if the respectable
young women&mdash;of whom there are thousands in England who do
not care for the pittance given to a governess, and <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>who prefer
the life of a lady-help&mdash;were to come out.&nbsp; They would
soon be appreciated.</p>
<p>The average girl selected to be sent out to the colony, so far
as I have seen her, is not a model of loveliness or
utility.&nbsp; Were I a Canadian mother, I would sooner have a
lady-help.&nbsp; Nor need the lady-help be afraid of the
roughness of her lot.&nbsp; In Ontario, all the difficulties of
the pioneers of civilization have long since disappeared.&nbsp;
One hears strange tales of what those brave men and delicately
nurtured ladies had to suffer.</p>
<p>I have seen two&mdash;whom I had known when a boy&mdash;who
were familiar with the best of London literary society, who
figured in all the annuals of the season, who were famous in
their day, whose sires came over with William the
Conqueror.&nbsp; They were sisters, and married two officers, who
had land allotted to them in Canada, and brought out these
wellborn and delicately nurtured women into what was then a
waste, howling wilderness, where <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>they had to slave as no servant-girl
slaves in England, and to fight with the severity of the climate
in a way of which the present generation of Canadians have no
idea.&nbsp; Only think, for instance, of your joint roasting at
the fire on one side and freezing on the other!&nbsp; In the
settled parts of Canada, such horrors are now amongst the
pleasant reminiscences of the past.</p>
<p>But I must return to Ottawa, where the universal testimony of
all the heads of the Government was to the effect that Canada is
the place for the poor, hard-working man.&nbsp; There is an
emigration-office in every town, where the emigrant is sure to
hear of work, if work is to be had.</p>
<p>Canada is a charming place for the traveller.&nbsp; He sees
friends everywhere.&nbsp; Mr. John H. Pope, Minister of
Agriculture, and Mr. John Lowe, Secretary, were especially useful
in aiding me.&nbsp; As I called on the Minister of Finance, he
insisted on <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>my seeing the Premier&mdash;Sir John Macdonald&mdash;who
came out of a Council to give me a friendly chat for half an
hour, and who kindly asked me to call on him again on my
return.&nbsp; In Canada the Council sits almost daily, and the
sitting generally lasts from two till six, as all the business
which is left in England to the departments, in Canada is
transacted in the Council.&nbsp; Sir John seemed to think that a
good deal of time was wasted in speeches in Parliament, which
were intended not for the House, but for the constituents
outside: in this respect the Canadian Parliament much resembles a
more august assembly nearer home.</p>
<p>I had also the honour of an interview with the Marquis of
Lansdowne at the Government House, in a pretty park about a mile
out of the town.&nbsp; His lordship enjoys his residence at
Ottawa very much, and said he should leave it with regret.&nbsp;
His idea seemed to be that now was the time for English farmers
with a little capital to come out to Ontario, <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>as the old
farmers are selling off their farms and going further, to take up
large tracts of land in the North-West; and I think many English
farmers would be wise if they adopted some such plan.&nbsp; The
Province is called the Garden of Canada.</p>
<p>At present I have seen no very superior land.&nbsp; There is a
good deal of sand where I have been and wheat-growing is out of
the question; but the barley is excellent, and is in great demand
in the United States, and a good deal of money is made by raising
stock and horses.&nbsp; At any rate, no farmer here is in danger
of losing all his capital&mdash;most of them are well off, and
their sons and daughters prosper as well.</p>
<p>Let me give a few further particulars respecting Sir John
Macdonald&mdash;perhaps the most abused, and the hardest working
man, in all Canada.&nbsp; He has good Scotch blood in his
veins.&nbsp; In the thirteenth century one of his ancestors looms
up as <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Lord
of South Kintyre and the Island of Islay.&nbsp; When the
emigration movement to Canada began, a descendant of this
Macdonald settled in Kingston, then the most important town in
Upper Canada, and, next to Halifax and Quebec, the strongest
fortress in British North America.&nbsp; He was accompanied by
the future Premier, then a lad of five years of age.&nbsp; The
boy was placed at the Royal Grammar School of Kingston, under the
tuition of Dr. Wilson, a fellow of the University of Oxford, and
subsequently under that of Mr. George Baxter.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
his father moved to Quint&eacute; Bay, near the Lake of the
Mountain, a lonely, wild country, in which the future Canadian
statesman was often to be seen in the holiday time, with a
fishing rod in his hand, with other companions as gay-hearted as
himself.&nbsp; At that time he is described as having &lsquo;a
very intelligent and pleasing face, strange furry-looking hair,
that curled in a dark mass, and a striking nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Indeed,
Sir John&rsquo;s admirers see in him a resemblance to the late
Lord Beaconsfield, and that there is a slight resemblance the
most superficial observer must admit.&nbsp; As a lad, Sir John
seems to have specially distinguished himself in
mathematics.&nbsp; His master also, we are told, frequently
exhibited the clean-kept books of young Macdonald to some
careless student for emulation, and as often selected specimens
of the neat penmanship of the boy, to put to shame some of the
slovenly writers of his class.</p>
<p>At sixteen young Macdonald commenced the study of law, to
which he devoted three years.&nbsp; The gentleman to whom he was
articled speaks of him as the most diligent student he had ever
seen.&nbsp; Before he was twenty-one years of age he was admitted
to the Bar, opened an office at Kingston, and at once began to
practise his profession.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was,&rsquo; says a
fellow-student, &lsquo;an exemplary young man, and had the
goodwill of everybody.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>He remained closely at his business,
never went about spreeing, or losing his time, with the young men
of his own age and standing, did not drive fast horses, but was
always to be found at his post in his office, courteous,
obliging, and prompt.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Sir John commenced his
legal career, the country was full of revolution, and every
county in Canada had its Radicals ready to take up muskets or
pitchforks against the oppressor.&nbsp; Sir John, though a Tory,
was often the means of doing good service to his friends of the
opposite party.&nbsp; In defending a rebel who was tried for
murder, the future Premier gained his first legal success.&nbsp;
It was a time of intense excitement, and crowds thronged to see
the prisoners and hear the trials.&nbsp; Everyone was struck with
the masterly character of Sir John&rsquo;s defence; and though
they knew it was not within the power of human tongue or brain to
save the prisoner, they admired the skill with which he
marshalled <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>his arguments, the tact he displayed in his appeal to
the judges, and, above all, the deep interest he displayed in the
cause of his unfortunate client.&nbsp; This was in 1838; from
that date Sir John was looked to as a rising man.&nbsp; In a
little while afterwards he commenced his stormy political
career.</p>
<p>In 1841 Kingston was made the seat of Government, and Sir John
was returned to Parliament, in place of a politician who had lost
his popularity.&nbsp; The assembly was an excited one, and
everyone made furious speeches, with the exception of the new
member, who sat unmoved at his desk while the fray went on,
looking, says a gentleman who well remembers him there, half
contemptuous and half careless.&nbsp; In 1844, he commenced his
executive career by being appointed to the Standing Orders
Committee.&nbsp; His first speech was delivered with an easy air
of confidence, as captivating as it was rare.&nbsp; The time
ripened rapidly.&nbsp; The <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>old Tory Compact Party was being
swiftly broken up, and when Lord Elgin arrived in Canada, a new
Government was formed, with Sir John as Receiver-General.&nbsp;
In a little while he was moved to the Office of Crown Lands, then
the most important department in the public service, and one that
in the past had been most shamefully, if not most criminally
abused, but he was soon out of office, and a new Ministry came
into force, pledged to a Bill for the indemnification of parties
in Lower Canada whose property had been destroyed in the
rebellion.&nbsp; There were awful riots.&nbsp; The Parliament
buildings in Montreal were burned, and it seemed as if the old
feud between Frenchman and Englishman had been roused, never more
to die.</p>
<p>Lord Elgin was ready to return to England The reformers were
strong, but Macdonald did not despair.&nbsp; The new Government,
amongst other things, were pledged to <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>increased parliamentary
representation, the abolition of seignorial tenure, and the
secularization of the Clergy Reserves.&nbsp; Of the Government
that attempted to do this, Sir John was a bitter opponent, on the
ground that they had hesitated about questions which had set the
country in a blaze.&nbsp; The Government had to retire, and in
the Liberal-Conservative Ministry which succeeded to office we
find Mr. Macdonald Attorney General, and he held office till he
was defeated in his Militia Bill.&nbsp; He returned to office,
however, in time to carry a confederation of the Colonies, and to
become Premier, when Lord Monck was Governor-General.</p>
<p>Since he has been at the head of affairs the Hudson Bay
Company has handed over its gigantic territory in the North West
to the Dominion.&nbsp; That great work, the Canada Pacific
Railway, has nearly been brought to a successful termination, and
Canada <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>has
taken a leap upwards and onwards to matured life and
independence, of which not yet have we seen the end.&nbsp; It is
a terrible scene of personal attack, political life in
Canada.&nbsp; Even since Parliamentary Government has been
established, the fight between the ins and the outs has been
bitter and constant.&nbsp; No one can understand it, unless he is
a native of the country; and it says much for Sir John that he
has risen to the top, and kept himself there so long.&nbsp; To
have done so, he must have possessed more merit than his enemies
give him credit for.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">TORONTO&mdash;THE TOWN&mdash;THE
PEOPLE&mdash;CANADIAN AUTHORS&mdash;THE LEADER OF THE
OPPOSITION.</p>
<p>Toronto, or the Queen City of the West, as she loves to call
herself, stands upon the north shore of Lake Ontario, and has not
only achieved a great success, but may be said, in spite of all
the moving to the North-West of which we hear so much, to have a
great future before it, on account of its position with regard to
railways, which alone in this great country decide the fate of
towns and cities.&nbsp; Immediately in front is a broad bay, from
which you get an imposing view of the city, while its forest of
spires and factory chimneys gives evidence of prosperous and busy
life.&nbsp; I have <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>never been in a city where the Sabbath was more strictly
observed.&nbsp; The omnibus ceases to run on a Sunday, the cab is
locked up, and even the cigar-store is closed.&nbsp; At seven on
Saturday evening all the liquor-shops are shut, and in Toronto,
as in all the Province, no one can buy a drop of whisky, or wine,
or beer, till a decent hour on Monday morning.&nbsp; It is true,
I was invited one Sunday to go and have a glass of whisky and
water&mdash;an offer which, it is needless to say, I refused; but
then, had I accepted the offer, I should have had to go into a
club of which my friend was a member.&nbsp; In Canada, as in
England, the club-member may indulge his taste, however strictly
the abstinence of his less fortunate brother may be enforced by
law.&nbsp; But the Sunday quiet of Toronto is remarkable.&nbsp;
There are few people but church-goers in the streets, and the
churches of all religious denominations are quite as numerous and
quite as handsome as any we have in England.&nbsp; <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>They are all
built on a larger scale, and are all well-filled.&nbsp; On Sunday
evening I had to light my way into the Congregational church, of
which Dr. Wild is the minister.&nbsp; He hails from America, and
is quite the sensation of the hour.&nbsp; There was no
standing-room anywhere, and as I made to the door I met many
coming away.&nbsp; However, I had made up my mind to hear the
Doctor, and hear him I did.&nbsp; It seems that the subscribers
have a door to themselves; I made for it, and luckily found a
chair, which I wedged in under the platform.&nbsp; As I entered,
the Doctor was making the people laugh by answering questions
that had been sent to him in writing.&nbsp; Then we had quite a
service of song.&nbsp; The choir behind him performed, a lady
sang a solo, the congregation joined in a well-known English
hymn.&nbsp; The Doctor prayed, and then we had a sermon about
Revelation, containing much that was very effective, if not about
his text, at any rate about that mysterious part of Scripture <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>from which
the text was taken.&nbsp; The Doctor is now in the prime of life,
and his preaching powerful and effective.&nbsp; The audience
consisted chiefly of men; perhaps that may be considered in the
Doctor&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; One thing did surprise me, and that
was to see seated at a table right under the pulpit platform a
reporter coolly taking notes.&nbsp; Our English reporters in a
place of worship on a Sunday are certainly more modest, and
prefer to blush unseen.</p>
<p>Toronto rises up, with its grand public buildings, proudly
from the shore.&nbsp; The site of the city was very marshy, and
at one time it was known as Muddy York.&nbsp; Only yesterday a
lady was telling me how her mother was near losing her life in
the mud of the chief street, leaving behind her the English
pattens of which she was so proud.&nbsp; The further from the
lake, the more the land rises, till you reach where, as Tom Moore
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&lsquo;The blue hills of old Toronto shed<br />
Their evening shadows o&rsquo;er Ontario&rsquo;s bed.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>In 1812 the population of the place was under 1,000.&nbsp; It
is now, including the suburbs, where some of the wealthiest
citizens live in houses as well-built and as luxuriously fitted
up as any in London, about 116,000.&nbsp; King Street, the
principal one, is built up with substantial brick and stone
buildings, many of which are equal to any on the American
Continent.&nbsp; Forty years since, it was completely composed of
wooden structures, and was barely passable to pedestrians.&nbsp;
Now, it is adorned with stately stores, where the latest
novelties of the Old World and the New are ostentatiously
displayed.&nbsp; The public buildings are quite an ornament to
the place, and the offices of the leading newspaper, <i>The
Toronto Mail</i>, are one of the sights of the city.&nbsp; The
yearly civic income and expenditure is over 2,000,000 dollars,
and the assessed value of property last year <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>was
61,942,581 dollars.&nbsp; The streets are spacious, well laid
out, and regularly built.&nbsp; The two main arteries of the city
are King and George Streets, which, crossing each other at right
angles, divide the city into four large sections.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think house-rent is cheap.&nbsp; I have been in one
or two private houses, the rents of which seemed to me certainly
dearer than would be the rents of similar houses in London.&nbsp;
But, then, in Toronto&mdash;think of it, O respected
Paterfamilias!&mdash;the best cuts of meat are about eightpence a
pound, and prime butter is not much more, and&mdash;Sir Henry
Thompson will rejoice to hear this&mdash;there is a plentiful
supply of fish.&nbsp; The city also boasts of fine theatres, and
halls, and colleges; while the Episcopalian Cathedral in James
Street possesses the celebrated chimney and illuminated clock
which took the first prize at the Vienna Exhibition, and which
was purchased by the citizens, and presented to the Dean <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and
churchwardens of the place on Christmas-eve, 1876.&nbsp; They
tell me, however, that the strongest body of Christians in the
city is that of the Wesleyans.&nbsp; I am staying at Walker
House, the most comfortable place which I have discovered thus
far.&nbsp; Toronto itself offers few opportunities to the
emigrant, and the citizens are not enthusiastic in his
favour.&nbsp; I met a reverend gentleman from England here, who,
the other night, at a meeting of mechanics, vainly endeavoured to
say a word in favour of emigration, and had to desist under the
threat that if he did not they would knock off his head.&nbsp;
The mechanics here are very much afraid that if more of their own
class come out, wages will be lowered.&nbsp; Nor are Irish
emigrants in much favour here, as they stop in the city instead
of going into the country in search of work, and have to be
supported by the charitable and humane.&nbsp; Only a few days
since a large batch of Irish arrived.&nbsp; Work had been found
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>for them
which they agreed to accept, and they were on the point of being
forwarded, when they were got at by the Irish already in the
city, and now they refuse to budge.</p>
<p>The other day I met Dr. Barnardo&rsquo;s agent, who has come
out with some of his trained boys to settle them in Peterborough,
where Mr. G. A. Cox, the Mayor of the place, has kindly given a
commodious house for their use.&nbsp; Already, I believe, the
Doctor has sent out 780 boys and about 470 girls, who have all
been planted out.&nbsp; Mr. W. Williams, of the <i>Chichester</i>
and <i>Arethusa</i>, has sent many more, and so have others, of
whom I hope to hear tidings in the course of my travel.&nbsp; The
manager of Dr. Barnardo&rsquo;s home at Peterborough, in answer
to inquiries from the farmers and others, writes that boys from
seven to twelve years of age are usually sent out on terms of
<i>adoption</i>, to be treated in every respect as children of
the <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>household, and to receive, on attaining their
twenty-first birthday, a sum of not less than one hundred and
fifty dollars.&nbsp; Boys of thirteen and over are hired as
&lsquo;helps,&rsquo; at wages varying from thirty-five to
ninety-five dollars per annum, with lodging, food, and medical
attendance.&nbsp; Girls are sent out at ages ranging from four to
sixteen years.&nbsp; Those of eleven and under are usually
<i>adopted</i> into families; while those of twelve and upwards
are hired at wages from two dollars to nine dollars a month, with
board, lodging, washing, and medical attendance.&nbsp; The utmost
care is taken that these children should be placed in good
hands.&nbsp; The applicant for a child has to get his letter
recommended by a clergyman or magistrate; then he has to give his
Christian name and surname in full, his address, his occupation;
to say if he hires his farm, or if it is his own; whether he is a
member of a Christian Church; what work the child will have to
perform; on what <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>terms the child comes into the family; what length of
engagement is desired; what church the child will attend; and so
on.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Barnardo&rsquo;s system provides for the regular
and frequent visitation of every young emigrant at his or her
place of employment; the girls by a lady of great experience, the
boys by a gentleman.&nbsp; By this means the children are never
lost sight of, and trustworthy reports of their progress and
whereabouts are periodically furnished to the heads of the
institution in England.</p>
<p>Now, I call attention to this plan, not merely to increase
confidence in the labours of philanthropists who are sending out
children to Canada, but in order to raise the question, why it is
only the children of the destitute and the wild arabs of the
street that are to have this advantage.&nbsp; There must be many
poor people in England who have sons, perhaps a little too plucky
for home, who could pay to send out their lads, and would <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>be glad to do
so, if they saw a chance of their being placed in good
hands.&nbsp; There are many boys who would be glad to leave the
somewhat overcrowded house, and who would rejoice to fight the
battle of life in the New World under such advantageous
conditions.&nbsp; Why should they not have a chance?&nbsp; Why
should the destitute only be looked after?&nbsp; Why should not
some one in the same way lend a helping hand to the honest son of
the honest working man?&nbsp; It may be that his father may be
too old to emigrate.&nbsp; It may be that he is doing fairly well
at home, and that it is not worth his while to emigrate.&nbsp;
But why should not his son have a chance, and be sent out under a
system as excellent as that to which I have referred?&nbsp;
Assuredly that is a question to be asked by others.</p>
<p>But Dr. Barnardo says in his magazine, <i>Night and Day</i>,
that much injury to the work of emigration has been effected by
supposing that boys who have committed grave moral <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>faults can do
well, if only shipped off to Canada.&nbsp; He contends that a
number of young fellows of <i>that</i> sort sent to Canada, would
seriously prejudice the prospects of emigration generally; and he
urges in very strong terms that none but boys and girls of
thoroughly good physique, industrious, honest, and of good
general character, should be encouraged to emigrate upon any
pretext whatever.</p>
<p>Previous to my leaving Toronto I had the pleasure of an
interview with the Hon. Edward Blake, the head of the Opposition,
whose utterances are watched and waited for by all parties in the
State with breathless interest.&nbsp; Travelling from Winnipeg, I
had listened to a conversation on that gentleman&rsquo;s merits
by two young gentlemen&mdash;who were a little incoherent in
their language, owing to the quantity of refreshment they had on
board&mdash;which certainly somewhat raised my
expectations.&nbsp; Nor was I disappointed <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>on my
personal interview with the subject of their praise.</p>
<p>The Hon. Edward Blake is a man in the prime of life, of fresh
complexion, of more than average height and build, with a keen
and intellectual face.&nbsp; He was born in Canada, was educated
at the University, followed his father in the profession of the
bar, and as a cross-examiner, especially of an unwilling witness,
and in the art of turning a man inside out, may claim to have no
equal in Canada at the present time.&nbsp; He has visited Europe
more than once&mdash;at one time in an official
capacity&mdash;has mixed with our public men as well as with
those of the Continent, has been in office, and, it is believed,
will soon be in office again.&nbsp; He received me with great
courtesy, and talked on things in general in a lively and
interesting manner.&nbsp; On the Province of Ontario as a home
for the British farmer he had much to say.</p>
<p>Taking me to the map hanging up in his <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>office, and
pointing to the district between Toronto and Detroit, he affirmed
that there was no finer land to be found anywhere in the United
States.&nbsp; His first constituency was a very poor
one&mdash;consisting of English settlers and others who had gone
there with very little, if any, money, and they had all done
well, and their children were now mostly wealthy men.&nbsp; He
did not approve of the Government plan of emigration; but he did
think there was a fine field in Canada for the British farmer and
his men.&nbsp; As to mechanics, he thought the look-out was
poor.&nbsp; The mechanic in that part of the world leads a very
migratory life.&nbsp; Such was the facility offered by railways,
which ran in all directions, that a slight rise in the rate of
wages would send him wherever that rise was to be found.&nbsp; At
the present time there was a depression of trade in the United
States, and wages were low.&nbsp; In Canada the wages were a
little higher, and he looked to <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>an emigration from the United States;
and then the wages in Canada would go down.</p>
<p>The British mechanic would thus have to face a double
difficulty&mdash;the competition of the Canadian and the American
mechanic alike.&nbsp; I must add, however, that this was not the
view of an English mechanic who had been settled in Toronto some
years, and with whom, subsequently, I had some chat.&nbsp; His
opinion was that any first-class English mechanic who came out
would do well, while he frankly admitted that an inferior hand
would have no chance whatever.</p>
<p>But to return to Mr. Blake.&nbsp; It is evident, though he and
his party are supposed to be in favour of Free Trade&mdash;and it
is a matter of fact that they were driven from place and power by
a Protectionist outcry&mdash;that he does not consider the
question of Free Trade from an English standpoint at all.&nbsp;
It will be long ere Canada will lift up her voice in favour of
Free Trade.&nbsp; In Canada <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>there is no such thing as direct
taxation, and as money has to be raised for the support of
Government, it is felt it is easier to do that by means of a duty
on foreign manufactures than by taking it directly out of the
pockets of the people.</p>
<p>Just now there is a feeling growing up in favour of Free Trade
with America; but that will not aid the British manufacturer one
jot.&nbsp; The system of duties between Canada and America is an
enormous nuisance, when one thinks of the daily personal and
commercial intercourse between the two countries.&nbsp; For
instance, I lost by changing English money into Canadian dollars;
and then again, when I had to change Canadian dollars into
American greenbacks, I had to submit to a further loss.&nbsp;
This was not pleasant, especially when you remember that every
time you cross the frontier&mdash;and people are doing it
daily&mdash;you have to submit to a disagreeable examination on
the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>part
of Custom House officers.&nbsp; Surely Canada and America will
before long have to come to a better understanding than that
which at present exists.&nbsp; Of course, I write under
correction.&nbsp; I am an outsider.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you tell me,&rsquo; I said to the Hon. E. Blake,
&lsquo;how I am to get to a knowledge of Canadian
politics?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His reply, and it was delivered with a smile, was:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By living in the country some five or six
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under such circumstances I feel, with the poet, that
&lsquo;where ignorance is bliss &rsquo;tis folly to be
wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On one thing Mr. Blake was silent&mdash;nor did I allude to
it: that was the question of Canadian independence.&nbsp; It is
raised in many quarters, it is almost daily discussed in the
Canadian newspapers.&nbsp; People are waiting to hear what Mr.
Blake has to say on it.&nbsp; At present the oracle is
dumb.&nbsp; When <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>the question is settled you may be sure sentiment will
have little to do with it; on this side of the Atlantic, at any
rate, that sort of thing goes a very little way when the almighty
dollar is at stake.&nbsp; But the question to be asked is, How
long Canadian independence will stand the cry for annexation with
the United States that will then be raised?</p>
<p>One of the pleasures attending my visit to Toronto was the
finding out Mrs. Moodie&mdash;whose &lsquo;Roughing It in the
Bush&rsquo; did so much to help English people to understand the
hardships of Canadian life some forty years ago.&nbsp; She was
the youngest sister of Agnes Strickland; and, like her, wrote
books for children, and tales and poems for the annuals, then the
rage.&nbsp; She then married a Major Moodie, and went out to
Canada, and I had not seen her since I was a raw lad; but of her
kindness and her talent I had a distinct impression, and it was
with real <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>pleasure that I found her living at an advanced
age&mdash;but in peace and comfort&mdash;at her son&rsquo;s, a
gentleman connected with the Inter-Colonial Railway.&nbsp; The
sprightly lady of 1834, eager and enthusiastic, had become an
elderly one in 1884; yet time had dealt gently with her, and her
youth seemed to me to revive as she talked of her old Suffolk
home, and of men and women long since gone over to the
majority.</p>
<p>I was glad to find that she had made her mark in Canadian
literature.&nbsp; An intelligent Canadian critic, Mr. J. E.
Collins, whose acquaintance I was privileged to make&mdash;as
well as that of his friend, Mr. Charles Robins, a poet of whom
Canada may well be proud&mdash;writes of Mrs. Moodie: &lsquo;So
perfect a picture is Mrs. Moodie&rsquo;s book of the struggles,
the hopes, the dark days, and the sun-spots of that obscure life
that fell to her lot in the forest depths, that its whisperings
form a delightful music to the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>memory.&nbsp; The style is limpid as
a running brook, picturesque, and abounding with touches that
show a keen insight into character, and an accurate observation
of external things.&nbsp; There is no padding or fustian in the
book, and no word is squandered, Mrs. Moodie regarding the
mission of language to be to convey thought, not to put on a
useless parade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moodie has been living in Canada now fifty years, and
loves to talk of the old country, especially of the people with
whom she associated when, as Susannah Strickland, she used to
stay in London with Pringle, the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery
Society, whose beautiful poem, &lsquo;Afar in the desert I love
to ride,&rsquo; is still a favourite with the English
public.&nbsp; But she has no wish to come back to
England&mdash;her family are all well settled in Canada.&nbsp;
She lives with one of her sons, and her daughter, Mrs.
Chamberlain, of Ottawa, has won <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>deserved fame by her beautiful
illustrations of Canadian flowers and lichens.</p>
<p>English readers who may remember Mrs. Moodie as one of the
gifted Strickland sisters will be glad to learn that she is
regarded as one of the pioneers of Canadian literature, and
although born near the beginning of the present century,
possesses a mental vigour and active memory rare in one so
aged.&nbsp; She told me anecdotes of myself when a boy that I had
quite forgotten, and retains in old age the enthusiasm for which
she was remarkable when young.&nbsp; Some of her ghost-stories
were capital.&nbsp; For instance, one night, when her sister
Agnes was lying sick, in the old hall at Reydon, Suffolk, and was
being nursed by her sister Jane, there came to them a tall,
stately figure in white, with long garments trailing behind
her.&nbsp; Of course, Agnes and her sister were very much
frightened at the apparition, which stood at the door, pointed
her finger <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>at Agnes, hissed at her, and then disappeared.&nbsp;
Other stories followed, equally interesting, in which Mrs.
Moodie, it was evident, firmly believed.</p>
<p>It was during her long and lonely residence in the woods that
Mrs. Moodie performed most of her literary work.&nbsp; While her
husband was away crushing the Rebellion, she wrote her
&lsquo;Roughing It in the Bush,&rsquo; which did more to
establish her fame in Canada and in England than any of her
previous productions.&nbsp; It is probably the best picture we
have of Canadian life at that time, and written in a style of
composition charming, if only on account of its ease.&nbsp;
Undisturbed by household cares, she wrote no less than fifteen
books for children; a larger work, &lsquo;Life in the
Clearings,&rsquo; and in addition contributed a mass of matter to
the old Canadian <i>Literary Garland</i>, sufficient to fill
several large volumes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I remember seeing Carlyle
once,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but he was <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>such a
crabbed-looking man that I did not care to make his
acquaintance.&nbsp; In fact, his appearance was quite the reverse
of pleasing, but he was an honest, close-fisted man, I dare
say.&rsquo;&nbsp; She had a good deal to say of Cruikshank, who
lived next door to Pringle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I went to hear Dan
O&rsquo;Connell,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;on the Anti-Slavery
question.&nbsp; He was completely dressed in green&mdash;green
coat, green vest, green pants&mdash;everything green but his
boots.&nbsp; I was greatly amused at his opening remark,
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;England
reminds me in this great question of a large lion that has been
sleeping a good many years, commencing to rouse itself, stretch,
yawn, and wag its tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; For days after, that lion,
with its wagging tail, came visibly before me.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
also remembered Shiel, who began his speech in Exeter Hall, then
quite a new building, by saying that he was afraid he would not
be able to make himself heard, <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and then roared so that he might have
been heard at Somerset House.&nbsp; She saw the man in armour
proclaim King William in Cheapside, and it touched her to tears
when all the people cried: &lsquo;God save the King!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;At one time,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I helped Pringle to
edit one of his annuals.&nbsp; Proctor sent in his poem on
&ldquo;The Sea, the Sea,&rdquo; and after reading it I
recommended it for publication, but Pringle rejected it.&nbsp;
However, afterwards he found out his mistake when the poem,
published in another channel, brought fame to its
author.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moodie seemed to think that it was a great privilege to
have been in London while the Catholic Emancipation Act and the
Reform Bills were carried, and still in her comfortable house in
Toronto loves to talk of the bustle and excitement of the
time.&nbsp; I was privileged twice to see her, and then we
parted, never more to meet&mdash;in this world, at least.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Near
Peterborough, about a hundred and fifty miles from Toronto, I
found another far-famed Canadian authoress, Mrs. Traill, whose
&lsquo;Backwoods of Canada,&rsquo; published when I was a lad by
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful and Entertaining
Knowledge, and now, I believe, by Messrs. Routledge and Sons, was
a delight to me in my young days.&nbsp; I remember her well as a
young woman, tall and stately, with a wonderful flow of
talk&mdash;enthusiastic as a worshipper of nature&mdash;ever
ready to write of Suffolk lanes, with all their richness of
floral and animal life; of Suffolk copses, where the birds sang,
and the partridge and the pheasant and the timid hare found
shelter; of farmers, then merry, and of peasants, then contented
with their humble lot.</p>
<p>In person she was attractive, the most so, to my mind, of all
the Strickland family, and she was very stately in manner, for
was <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>not
her maiden name Katherine Parr Strickland, and had she not some
of the blood of that family allied to royalty in her veins?&nbsp;
The Stricklands came of an ancient and honoured line, and besides
that, there is a great deal in names, as the reader of
&lsquo;Tristram Shandy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kenelm Chillingly&rsquo;
perfectly understands.&nbsp; What could you expect of a Katherine
Parr Strickland but queenly manner, as assuredly the young lady
who bore that name had?</p>
<p>When I was a lad, she married a Major Traill, and accompanied
her sister, Mrs. Moodie, to Canada.&nbsp; I cannot think how
ladies thus tenderly nursed could have done anything of the
kind&mdash;or, having done it, how they could have survived the
hardships they were called to endure.&nbsp; The lot in their case
was by no means cast in pleasant places.&nbsp; Mrs. Moodie, in
her delightful book, &lsquo;Roughing It in the Bush,&rsquo; says:
&lsquo;A large number of the immigrants were officers of the army
and navy, with their families&mdash;a class perfectly <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>unfitted by
their previous habits and standing in society for contending with
the stern realities of emigrant life in the backwoods.&nbsp; A
class formed mainly from the younger scions of great families,
naturally proud, and not only accustomed to command, but to
receive implicit obedience from the people under them, are not
men adapted to the hard toil of the woodman&rsquo;s
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet it was to such a life Major Traill took his handsome and
accomplished wife; but Mrs. Traill in her backwoods settlement
was not forgetful of the literary vocation to which she had
dedicated her early youth.&nbsp; I have already referred to her
&lsquo;Backwoods of Canada&rsquo;; that was in due time followed
by a volume equally worthy of public favour, under the title of
&lsquo;Ramblings in a Canadian Forest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, she
and her sister may claim to have been the pioneers of Canadian
literature; and their brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Strickland, may
also claim to be <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>placed in that category by his work,
&lsquo;Twenty-seven Years in Canada West,&rsquo; a record of his
own experiences, abounding with numerous realistic touches.&nbsp;
He settled his family near his sister; and at Lakefield, near
Peterborough, the residence of Mrs. Traill, there is quite a
colony of Stricklands, who have all done well, so people tell me,
at the lumber trade.</p>
<p>I am glad I paid Mrs. Traill a visit.&nbsp; It was a long and
wearisome ride, but I was well repaid by a short interview with
one with whom I was familiar half a century back.&nbsp; Lakefield
is a charming spot, and Mrs. Traill&rsquo;s wooden but
picturesque cottage overlooks a lovely scene of trees and hills,
and water and grass.&nbsp; At any rate, in the early spring it
has a neat little garden; in new countries neat little gardens
are rare.</p>
<p>Mrs. Traill has seen great changes in her time.&nbsp; When she
came there, there were only one or two houses in Peterborough;
all <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>was
forest, and now it has a mayor and a town-hall, and is one of the
nicest towns in that part of Canada.&nbsp; Mrs. Traill&rsquo;s
cottage is fitted up with English comfort and taste.&nbsp; She
has around her books and photographs of loving relatives.&nbsp;
She showed me a book of hers recently published by Messrs. Nelson
and Sons.&nbsp; As a Canadian authoress, she has done much to
commemorate the beauty of Canadian forests, and writes of their
floral charms with all the tenderness and grace with which I
remember her sketches of East Anglian rural life were richly
adorned.&nbsp; She is now hard at work with a new volume on
Canadian lichens and flowers.</p>
<p>As we stood talking at the window&mdash;the sunbeams played
gaily on the blue waters of the lake or river beneath (in Canada
there are so many rivers and lakes that you can scarcely tell
which is which, or where the one ends or the other
begins)&mdash;fairy flowers were beginning to gem her lawn; and
the American <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>robin redbreast, a far larger bird than ours, and other
birds, still more graceful, flew among the trees&mdash;I felt
how, in such a spot, one weary of the world could lead a tranquil
life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Traill must be an advanced octogenarian&mdash;she is
older than Mrs. Moodie, and Mrs. Moodie claims to be far over
eighty.&nbsp; Yet Mrs. Traill retains her conversational power
intact, and is full as ever of &lsquo;the lore that nature
brings,&rsquo; and is as enthusiastic as ever in its
pursuit.&nbsp; As much as ever her manners are queenlike.&nbsp;
They have never left her, in spite of all the hardships she has
had to undergo as wife and mother in the wilderness, and her face
still retains something of the freshness and fairness of her
youth.&nbsp; She is a wonderful old lady, and Canada must be a
wonderful country for such.</p>

104</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">OFF TO THE NORTH-WEST&mdash;NIAGARA&mdash;LAKE
SUPERIOR&mdash;THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY&mdash;AT
WINNIPEG.</p>
<p>As in duty bound, I have reached Niagara Falls, and from
motives equally conscientious forbear to trouble you with either
poetry or prose on the scene that now meets my eye.&nbsp; In
seeing them I have an advantage&mdash;that in this early season
of the year I am alone and free from the crowd of visitors that
sometimes infest the spot.&nbsp; As it is, there is quite enough
of modern civilization there to disturb the poetry of the place;
and the scream of the steam-engine sadly interferes with the
enjoyment of that everlasting roar which rises as <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the vast
body of waters tumbles over the falls&mdash;raising up majestic
mountains of mist&mdash;and then sweeps grandly to the rapids, in
the raging whirlpools of which poor Captain Webb lost his life,
or, in plainer words, committed suicide.&nbsp; Then there are the
cabmen, who will not give you a moment&rsquo;s peace, and affect
not to understand you when you intimate that you prefer to walk
rather than to ride; and a grand walk it is, about a mile from
the station on the Canadian side.&nbsp; Far, far below is the
river&mdash;a chasm in a mass of old dark rock&mdash;into which
you peer with wondering eyes till the brain is almost
dizzy.&nbsp; Words fail to convey the impressions, as passing
cloud and fleeting sunshine add to the marvellous beauty of the
spot.&nbsp; I scrambled down to where the ferry-boat is, and
drank in all the charm of the place, not caring to be ferried
across, quite satisfied with watching the eternal fall of water
as I sat there&mdash;a mere human speck in that mysterious
grandeur.&nbsp; <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>The white man has come and made the place his
own.&nbsp; He has now thrown three bridges across it, and on the
American side has built a brewery, whose &lsquo;Niagara
ales&rsquo; are famous all over the American Continent.&nbsp; I
am glad to say that it is only on the Canadian side that you have
a good view of the Falls; but on neither side is there what there
ought to be, a wilderness.&nbsp; On each side there are houses
and hotels, and churches, all the way; and I was offered
Guinness&rsquo;s Dublin Stout and Bass&rsquo;s Pale Ale, just as
if I were dining in a Fleet Street restaurant.&nbsp; On my return
I met a funeral procession.&nbsp; Death had come into one of the
wooden houses on the side, and the friends and relatives had
ridden in their buggies and country carts to pay the last tribute
of respect to the deceased.&nbsp; Yes; death is lord of
life&mdash;in the New World as well as in the Old.</p>
<p>I went then by way of Hamilton, through a district as fertile
and as well-farmed as any <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>in England, looking far more
civilized than any part I have yet seen.&nbsp; There are no
stumps of trees in the ground, as there are elsewhere, and the
houses look as if they had been built long enough to allow of
home comforts; and, as Hamilton is the place to which many of our
poor lads are sent, I was glad to feel that in such a district
they would have few hardships to encounter, and would have every
chance of getting on.&nbsp; Here at one time there were bears and
wolves; but they have long since disappeared before the march of
their master, man.&nbsp; It is not so long since there was quail
shooting on the very site of the city of Toronto, and hawks would
carry off the chickens the earlier emigrants were attempting
painfully to rear, and the Indians were also unwelcome
guests.&nbsp; I have heard of an old Scotch settler who, as his
last resort, invoked the aid of bagpipes, wherewith to frighten
his unwelcome guests; but even that did not frighten the Indians,
who <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>carried off the contents of his potato ground,
undisturbed by a musical performance which would have struck
terror into the stoutest English heart.&nbsp; Well, all that wild
forest region is now the home of peace and plenty, and distant be
the day when Professor Goldwin Smith&rsquo;s idea will be
realized, and it has been peacefully annexed by the United
States.&nbsp; Out in Canada that idea finds little favour.&nbsp;
Why should it?&nbsp; It is a favourite boast with Americans that
Canada will ultimately be theirs.&nbsp; I am sure that is not a
favourite idea of the Canadians themselves.&nbsp; Great Britain,
it is to be hoped, will be as loyal to Canada as Canada is to
her.</p>
<p>The thing is not to be settled quite so easily as Professor
Goldwin Smith anticipates.&nbsp; In Quebec Province we have a
million of French Canadians, who make no secret of their
preference to a French rather than an English alliance, and who
are quite prepared to act accordingly, as soon as British
authority <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>shall have become relaxed.&nbsp; Then we have the
Acadians of Nova Scotia, who would probably follow the lead of
French Canada; nor could the few Britishers of New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island escape the same fate.&nbsp; France is quite
prepared to increase her influence in this part of the
world.&nbsp; Indeed, at the present moment there is talk of her
buying the island of Anticosti, which, as you may be aware,
though almost uninhabited now&mdash;save in the summer, when the
fishermen go there&mdash;makes a very respectable appearance in
the river St. Lawrence.&nbsp; Then we come to Ontario, which,
placed as she is, could not withstand an attack from the United
States.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the Yankees did make an attempt of the
kind&mdash;that was in 1837&mdash;an attempt which the loyal men
of Canada helped Sir Francis Head to put down.&nbsp; Toronto
escaped, though she had the enemy <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>at her very gates.&nbsp; I must say
that all the Canadians with whom I have spoken have no wish to
become Americans.&nbsp; For one thing, they say they can&rsquo;t
afford it.&nbsp; Government is more costly in America than in
Canada.&nbsp; I admit as much as anyone the right of the people
to decide their fate.&nbsp; If the Canadians prefer to live under
the star-spangled banner, it is vain for us to attempt to retain
them.&nbsp; But the danger is the indifference of the English
public as to the value of such a colony as that of Canada, a
country bigger than all Europe, and at present with a sparse
population only equalling that of London.&nbsp; A few brief facts
will show the importance of the North-West to the English, not
merely as a field for emigration, but for other reasons as
well.</p>
<p>From Liverpool to Winnipeg, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay, the distance is less by 1,100 miles than by way of the St.
Lawrence, and they are now talking of making a railway along that
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>route.&nbsp; From Liverpool to China and Japan,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> the northern route, the distance is 1,000 miles
shorter than by any other line.&nbsp; It is really 2,000 miles
shorter than by San Francisco and New York.&nbsp; How immense,
then, will be the power which the possession of Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay, and of the railway route through to the Pacific, must confer
upon Great Britain, so long as she holds it under safe
control!&mdash;and where is the nation that can prevent her so
holding it, as long as her fleets command the North
Atlantic?&nbsp; It is utterly inconceivable that English
statesmen would be found so mad or so unpatriotic as thus to
throw away the key of the world&rsquo;s commerce, by neglecting
or surrendering British interests in the North-West.&nbsp; Our
great cities would not sanction such a policy for an
instant.&nbsp; England could better afford to give up the Suez
Canal, or be rid of her South African colonies.&nbsp; The
interests of the two countries are inseparable.&nbsp; We require
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the
North-West to send us grain.&nbsp; She requires us as her best
customer.&nbsp; Manitoba has her natural market in Great Britain,
and in the near future Great Britain will have her best customers
in Manitoba and the North-Western Provinces.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the Canadians&mdash;that is, if figures
may be trusted&mdash;that they spend less on drink, and more on
education, than we do in the Old Country.</p>
<p>Party feeling runs high; but it is difficult to an outsider to
understand what is the line of separation between the ins and the
outs.&nbsp; An English writer tells us that she once asked a
member of the Greek Opposition in Parliament, what was the
difference between them and the Government.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; was his reply, &lsquo;it is this.&nbsp; If M.
Tricoupi says we want railroads, we say, &ldquo;No; we want
canals.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he says a thing must be done by horses,
we say, &ldquo;No; it must be done by oxen.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is just the same here.&nbsp; <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>What one party proposes the other
opposes.&nbsp; The present rulers rode into power on the wings of
Protection.&nbsp; They are Tories; but it is to be feared the
Liberals would have done the same, had they had a chance.&nbsp;
It is the fashion to use very bad language, and to imply the
worst of motives to your opponents; and it is in this easy way
the Canadian newspapers fill up their columns when they are
not&mdash;and this seems their great mission&mdash;quarrelling
with one another.</p>
<p>The country farmers, who are much keener men of business than
their fellow farmers in the Old Country, care little about
politics.&nbsp; At the last election a friend of mine said to a
farmer, &lsquo;Have you voted?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo;
was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, for which party?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ah, that was a question he could not answer.&nbsp; He had voted
as his neighbour told him; and he knew that his neighbour was a
real good man, and that he would not give him bad advice.&nbsp;
So long as voters <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>are thus simple, elections will be a mockery and a
sham.</p>
<p>I have left Toronto behind, and here I am on Lake Superior,
the largest body of fresh water in the world&mdash;so large is
it, that if you immerse in it Great Britain and Ireland, and add
the Isle of Man and the Isle of Wight, there would still be a
respectable amount of water to spare&mdash;enough, at any rate,
to make a river as long as the Thames, which we in England hold
to be a very decent sort of river indeed.&nbsp; As I came up the
St. Lawrence, some of the Canadians, who are, as they may well
be, proud of their grand river, asked me what I thought of
it.&nbsp; My reply was that for a colony so young, it was a very
tidy sort of river indeed; and I may say the same of the enormous
body of water on which I am now floating.&nbsp; It is a big thing
indeed&mdash;as might be expected, where both Canada and the
United States contribute to its bigness.&nbsp; We are in the
middle of the lake, having Michigan <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>on one side.&nbsp; Already we have
stopped twice&mdash;once to take a pilot, and then again at Le
Sault, where we had to stay while we waited our turn to enter the
canal which connects the Georgian Bay to Lake Superior.&nbsp;
There, indeed, we were made conscious of the fact that we were
within the United States, as the banner of the stars and stripes
floated proudly on each side of us, and there were a few soldiers
in blue regimentals standing on the wharf, to say nothing of
loafers, and boys and girls and half-breeds, to welcome our
arrival.</p>
<p>For one thing I felt proud of my country.&nbsp; The Americans
have nothing here equal to the <i>Algoma</i>, a crack steamer
built on the Clyde for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and to
which, at this present moment, are entrusted C&aelig;sar and his
fortunes.&nbsp; It is only the second trip the <i>Algoma</i> has
made, as for the greater season of the year this immense
water-way, incredible as it seems to us, is a solid block of ice,
and we have it all around us still.&nbsp; I <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>boarded the
<i>Algoma</i> on Saturday afternoon, after a rapid run by rail
from Toronto, which city we left in the morning at half-past
eleven, and I assure you I was glad the journey was safely over,
as once or twice it seemed to me, at one or two of the curves,
the cars were very near leaving the rails; and the boy&mdash;they
are all boys here&mdash;who had to attend to the brake, gave me a
grin, as if he thought that we had much to be thankful for that
we kept the track at all.&nbsp; I presume I shall get used to
that sort of thing, but at present the sensation experienced in
rounding some of the curves is more novel than agreeable.</p>
<p>We are a very miscellaneous company on board, chiefly Toronto
traders and stalwart boys from Manitoba, who have been enjoying a
holiday in Upper Canada, and emigrants.&nbsp; Gloves are unknown,
likewise hats and shirt-collars are the exception rather than the
rule.&nbsp; As to having one&rsquo;s boots blackened, that is
rather an expensive luxury, when you recollect <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the charge
is fivepence a pair, and no one on board apparently has had his
boots blackened for the last week or two; and I question much
whether I shall require any of Day and Martin till I get back to
Toronto again&mdash;an event which will take place apparently
about the time of the Greek kalends.&nbsp; Hitherto I have
managed the blacking difficulty most effectively.&nbsp; As far as
Toronto I travelled with my London friend, who, aware of the
custom of the country, had provided himself with the needful
materials for the fitting amount of polish, and who generously
permitted me to reap the benefit of his superior knowledge.&nbsp;
My first attempt, I fear, was a failure.&nbsp; In my bedroom at
the hotel I set to work, and soon acquired the requisite amount
of polish; but, alas! I had forgotten the effect of blacking on
clean sheets, and to my horror I discovered the bed-linen was, at
any rate, as plentifully covered with blacking as &lsquo;them
precious boots.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, I <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>did not
regret the catastrophe, as I hoped it might teach the landlord it
would be cheaper to get the boots of his guests blackened in an
efficient manner, than to leave such unskilful amateurs as myself
to do it on their own account.</p>
<p>Life on board the <i>Algoma</i> is as agreeable as can well be
imagined.&nbsp; We have three good meals a day.&nbsp; I am
writing in a magnificent saloon, nearly three hundred feet long,
and if the nights are cold, as they always are on the lakes, I
have a cabin all to myself, and by heaping the bed-clothes for
two berths on my bed, and throwing a heavy great-coat over them,
I manage to keep myself warm for the night.&nbsp; The scenery by
day is magnificent, as we sail in and out among a thousand isles,
all richly wooded to the water&rsquo;s edge, with here and there
a little village, or small settlement, where the woodmen ply
their calling&mdash;the results of which may be seen now in a
raft being towed by a tug, to be shipped lower <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>down to
Liverpool or Glasgow, or in stacks of planks along the
shore.&nbsp; Further behind is the mainland, with rock and wood
in endless succession.&nbsp; At Sault St. Marie, the river is
celebrated for its fish, and as you pass through the canal, you
have plenty of Indian canoes paddling about, with a man at the
stern to seize the fish by a hand-net: the white fish of Lake
Superior is held to be a great delicacy.&nbsp; After a day and
night, we get into the open lake, out of sight of land, and then
we land at Port Arthur, whence we take the train to Winnipeg,
where I hope to hear a scrap of English news.</p>
<p>I have but one complaint to make, and that is, on the Sunday
we had no service of any kind.&nbsp; I am not, nor ever was, a
stickler for forms; but there are times, especially as many now
on board may be planted far away from any religious observance,
when it seems to me a simple service might be the means of
strengthening old impressions, and perhaps <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>planting
new ones.&nbsp; One thinks of that fine old hymn of Andrew
Marvel&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What can we do but sing His praise,<br />
Who guides us through the watery maze?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an hour or so thus spent, surely may be quite as helpful
to the higher life we all dream of, at any rate, as the favourite
occupation of the majority&mdash;smoking and spitting, or the
study of the maps of the district to which we are all rapidly
approaching.&nbsp; I had a queer chat this morning with an old
Canadian farmer who landed at Le Sault.&nbsp; He was pleased to
hear that I had been at Yarmouth in Norfolk.&nbsp; His mother was
a Clarke of Yarmouth.&nbsp; Did I know any of the Clarkes of
Yarmouth?&nbsp; I replied that I had not that pleasure, but that
I knew many of the Clarkes, and that they were a
highly-respectable family indeed.</p>
<p>Well, I have now done with Ontario, and you ask me what I
think of it?&nbsp; I reply that it is a beautiful country, and
that it has room <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>for any amount of farm labourers and servant
girls.&nbsp; I have been talking with a gentleman this morning,
who tells me that he pays his groom about &pound;6 a month, and
that he boards him as well.&nbsp; He tells me of a Scotch
labourer who came out without &pound;1 in his pocket, and who has
just died worth &pound;12,000.</p>
<p>At Ottawa I saw a large lumber-yard worth many thousand
pounds, which was the property of one who came from England as a
working man.&nbsp; As to mechanics, I fear the case is
different.&nbsp; In Ontario, in all the towns, the mechanics have
strong unions, and they do all they can to keep out emigrants of
that class, fearing that their own wages will be reduced.&nbsp;
This dog-in-the-manger policy prevails everywhere, and many
mechanics, directly they land, are thus frightened by them, and
want to get back to England at once.&nbsp; There are two sides to
every question.&nbsp; All I can say is, that while a
mechanic&rsquo;s representative, at Montreal, was telling me that
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>there
was no room for mechanics, and was doing all he could to induce
those who came out with me to return to England at once, I saw an
advertisement with my own eyes in a local paper (I am sorry I
have forgotten the name) for five hundred mechanics, who were
immediately wanted.&nbsp; A man who has got a good situation in
England would be a fool to give it up and come out; but I believe
a mechanic who has a head on his shoulders&mdash;who is young and
in good health, and knows how to take advantage of his
situation&mdash;may find a living even in Ontario.&nbsp; This is
my deliberate conviction, after all I have seen and heard, and
with the full knowledge that in Montreal, and Ottawa, and
Toronto, there is a pauper class as badly off as any of the
denizens of our London slums.&nbsp; The people I most pity are
the young fellows who in England have had the training of
gentlemen, and who are sadly out of place in Canada, and whom the
Canadian mothers dread, <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>fearing that they may corrupt the
native youth.&nbsp; Many of them, however, are decent fellows;
but nevertheless, there is no room for them, unless they go out
to Manitoba, and get some farmer to give them board and lodging
for their work.&nbsp; I parted with quite a pang with one such on
Friday, at Toronto.&nbsp; He was the nephew of a well-known noble
lord, and really seemed a very decent sort of fellow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo; I said to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I
can row and play cricket,&rsquo; was his reply.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, Canada is not much of a country for
cricket&mdash;the summer season is too short; and I felt that my
young friend, unless he could turn his hand to something more
useful or lucrative, had better have remained at home.</p>
<p>The pleasant steamship journey ended, I landed at Port
Arthur&mdash;a town situated in one of the loveliest bays I have
yet seen, almost surrounded by weird and fantastic
rocks&mdash;with a view to run by the Canadian <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Pacific as
far as Winnipeg.&nbsp; As I landed a bill met my eye:
&lsquo;Wanted, a hundred rock-men and fifty labourers;&rsquo; and
that seemed to me an indication that emigrants need not go
begging for work in that particular locality.&nbsp; Port Arthur,
which stands near the ancient Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s station
of Fort William, was in a state of intense activity.&nbsp; Every
one was building wooden houses and shops who could do so.&nbsp;
According to all appearances, it is certainly a busy place; but
architecturally I cannot say that it is of much account.&nbsp;
The main street opens on to the railway, along which the engines,
ringing a doleful bell in order to bid passengers keep out of the
way, pass every few minutes.&nbsp; Then there are wooden shops
and wooden hotels, and the usual concourse of rough, unwashed,
half-dressed loafers in the streets.&nbsp; Behind them is the
forest and in front the bay, with its waters almost as clear as
those of the Baltic, and almost as blue as those of <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Naples.&nbsp; Yet I certainly got very heartily tired
of Port Arthur, and so, I am sure, did all my travelling
companions, who sat on the planks or on the wooden pavement,
which, being raised above the road, made passable seats, or on
the bits of rock which the railway builders had been too busy to
remove, wondering at what hour the train would start.&nbsp; I
pitied the poor emigrants, with their children, and their beds,
and their household furniture, as they sat there, hour after
hour, in that hot and sandy street.&nbsp; We landed at eleven,
having made the whole distance from Toronto&mdash;a run of about
eight hundred miles&mdash;in exactly two days and two
nights&mdash;not quite so long as Jonah was in the whale&rsquo;s
belly, but we certainly got over more ground than he did.&nbsp;
When were we to start?&nbsp; No one knew.&nbsp; It takes a long
time to get out &pound;4,000 worth of freight and
passengers&rsquo; luggage, and that is what the <i>Algoma</i> had
on board.&nbsp; The worst of railway travelling in <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Canada is
that there is no one of whom you can ask a question.&nbsp; There
may be a station-master, there may be a whole herd of officials,
there may be an army of porters, but Canadians in one respect
resemble the Americans&mdash;and that is, that they think it
inconsistent with their manly dignity to wear any kind of garb
which can in any possible way distinguish them from the crowd of
lookers-on, always to be met with in a railway station, so that
the railway traveller is always in a perplexity.&nbsp; When we
got on shore we were told that we should start in half an
hour.&nbsp; Then came word that we were to be off at half-past
one, and so, as soon as the cars were made up, we joyfully
climbed into them&mdash;and the steps are in many cases so high
that it is hard work climbing into them; but still we were no
further on our way, and it was not till a little before four
that, after many false starts, we could fairly believe that we
were off.&nbsp; Oh, it was wearisome work, but then it may be <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>asked,
Whoever travels on a railway for pleasure?&nbsp; It is true these
big American cars have certain advantages ours lack.&nbsp; You
can change your position; you can talk without breaking a
blood-vessel; and you can see more of the country, especially as
they do not go the pace we are accustomed to at home; but there
is such a confusion of persons in them, that to one accustomed to
the society to be met with in an English first-class carriage,
the result is anything but pleasing.&nbsp; In the Canadian
first-class carriage Jack and his master ride side by side,
unless the latter takes a berth in a sleeping car, for which he
has to pay extra.&nbsp; As I did not feel inclined to give three
dollars for a night&rsquo;s unquiet rest, I took my chance with
the first-class car company, and I can assure you that by the
time the dim grey of morning glimmered on the horizon, I had
heartily repented of my decision.&nbsp; The night was so cold
that everything in the way of ventilation was stopped <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>up.&nbsp;
The car was quite full, and few of my fellow travellers seemed to
have had much regard for soap and water.&nbsp; It is true there
was a lavatory attached to the car, but there was neither water
nor soap nor towels, and the neatness of the lavatory in other
respects only seemed to me to make matters worse.&nbsp; I must
say that the car, which was built in Canada, was a remarkably
handsome one, with its dark wood panels beautifully carved, and
its seats all lined with red velvet; yet when I left it in the
morning it was in a filthy state.&nbsp; I also found in it
agreeable society, but there were many who could not truthfully
be included in such a category&mdash;rough men and women with
whom in England you would not care to travel in a third-class
carriage: but I am an Englishman, and may be pardoned for not
knowing any better.&nbsp; It is to the same defect, perhaps, that
I may trace the disappointment I felt at the refreshment sheds,
in which we were permitted to snatch <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>a hasty meal, waited on by a man in
shirt-sleeves.&nbsp; Certainly we do that part of our business
better at home.&nbsp; The Canadian Pacific have a dining-room of
their own at Winnipeg, and there, if possible, the traveller
should endeavour to secure a meal.</p>
<p>But oh, that ride! I shall never forget it.&nbsp; Burns tells
us that Nature tried her &rsquo;prentice hand on man</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And then she made the lassies,
oh!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Nature must have made that part of Canada which lies
between Port Arthur and Winnipeg before she tried her hand on
Great Britain and Ireland.&nbsp; It is true some part of it has
an exquisite combination of wood and water and rock, but the
greater part was either forest or gigantic plains or valleys of
stone&mdash;which seemed to shut all hope from the
spectator.&nbsp; In Canada&mdash;that is, along the railway
lines&mdash;there is little life in the forest, few flowers
display their loveliness, and no <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>song-birds warble in the
trees.&nbsp; All is still&mdash;or would be, were it not for the
peculiar croaking of the frogs, to be heard like so many hoarse
whistles from afar.&nbsp; You go miles and miles without seeing a
farm or even a log-hut.&nbsp; In one place I saw an Indian
wigwam, much resembling a gipsy&rsquo;s tent, and a large canoe;
but dwellings of any kind are the exception, not the rule.&nbsp;
The train every now and then stops, but you see no station, and
why we stop is only known to the engine-driver.&nbsp; We take no
passengers up, and we set none down, or hardly ever.&nbsp; The
people who get in at Port Arthur only want to be taken to
Winnipeg.&nbsp; There is no traffic along the line, because there
are no inhabitants along the line, and for the greater part of
the way it is not only a solitary ride, but a rough one as
well.&nbsp; As you get nearer Winnipeg, the road is easier, and
the pace is more rapid.&nbsp; You leave behind you rocks and
forests, and reach an open plain on which you see, <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>perhaps, a
dozen cows, where millions might fatten and feed.&nbsp; A good
deal of this land, I am told, belongs to the half-breeds.&nbsp;
In time it is to be hoped that they may utilize it more than they
seem to do now.</p>
<p>A great change is impending over this part of the world.&nbsp;
Even that stony district of which I wrote, and which seemed to me
as the abomination of desolation, is, I hear, full of mineral
wealth, which will be brought to light as soon as a certain
boundary difficulty is settled&mdash;Ontario and Manitoba at
present are each contending for the prize&mdash;and the decision
of the question must shortly take place.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one thing that has most struck me with admiration
is the pluck which has given birth to the Canadian Pacific
Railway, by means of which the emigrant is taken from his landing
in Quebec to his destination on the slopes of the Pacific,
without ever leaving the Canadian soil.&nbsp; It is a patriotic
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>enterprise, for under the former system the emigrant
who intended to settle in Canada, and who, in reality, was wanted
there, was often tempted to change his mind and to settle in the
United States.&nbsp; It was a bold enterprise, for the cost was
enormous, and Canada is not a wealthy country.&nbsp; It was an
enterprise which was made the subject of party conflict.&nbsp;
Appalling difficulties have had to be surmounted by the
engineers.&nbsp; Yet all have been vanquished, and in a few
months this grand scheme will be an accomplished fact, and you
will be carried direct from one side of this enormous continent
to the other.&nbsp; I think Sir John Macdonald is to be
congratulated for the courage and tenacity he has displayed on
the subject, through good or bad report, and too much praise
cannot be awarded to Mr. George Stephens, who has been the ruling
spirit and life of the undertaking from the first, and I am sure
that such railway officials as those I have <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>met, such
as Mr. Van Horne, have proved loyal coadjutors, evincing a
similar wide grasp of mind and readiness of resource for which
Sir John himself is distinguished.</p>
<p>In England they are well represented by Mr. Begg, who, as he
knows the district well, can speak of it with a confidence and
certainty possessed by no one else.&nbsp; It is to him the credit
must be given of the Manitoba farm in the Forestry Exhibition at
Edinburgh last autumn, which was visited with much interest by
the Prince of Wales and Mr. Gladstone, and to which I was glad to
see, for I was there several days, the Scotch farmers and
agriculturists paid particular attention.&nbsp; Such men are an
honour to Canada, and may be ranked amongst its best
friends.&nbsp; It is to them that Canada owes her present proud
position and ability to find happy homes for the tens of
thousands of England and the Continent, whom she has rescued from
starvation, and whom she has placed in <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the way to
insure wealth and health and happiness.&nbsp; I find even poor
persecuted Jews driven from Russia on this fertile land, who,
under these favouring skies, have learned to become prosperous
farmers.&nbsp; One may well be proud of Canada, and be proud to
think Canada belongs to us.&nbsp; When Bret Harte asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Is our civilization a failure,<br />
Is the Caucasian played out?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I answer in Canada with an emphatic No!&nbsp; Canada is
redolent of industrial success.&nbsp; The very air of the place
is full of hope.</p>

<p>Not only has the Canadian Pacific Railway opened up the
country, but it has established experimental farms in different
parts, in order to test the capabilities of the soil and the
advantages or disadvantages of the climate.&nbsp; It is said, and
extensively believed, that the soil between Moose Jaw and Calgary
is made up of desert and alkali lands, and entirely unfit for
cultivation.&nbsp; With a view to correct <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>that idea,
ten farms were established at the following stations: 1,
Secretan; 2, Rush Lake; 3, Swift Current; 4, Gull Lake; 5, Maple
Creek; 6, Forres; 7, Dunmore; 8, Stair (these two being the
nearest stations east and west of Medicine Hat at the crossing of
the Saskatchewan River); 9, Tilley, and 10, Gleichen, the last
being within view of the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; The breaking
throughout was found to be easy, the soil in every case good and
in most instances excellent, ranking with the choicest lands in
the Company&rsquo;s more eastern belt: wherever the rating of the
soil is lowered, according to the Company&rsquo;s standard, owing
to its being of a lighter grade, the inferiority will be
compensated for by the certainty of the grain maturing more
rapidly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"Calico Island, Saskatchewan River, Canadian North-West"
title=
"Calico Island, Saskatchewan River, Canadian North-West"
src="images/p135.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In a pamphlet just issued it is stated that the average from
all the farms was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Wheat 21&frac12; bushels; oats, 44&frac14;;
barley, 23&frac14;; peas, 12&frac12;.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&lsquo;The above yields were ascertained by accurately
chaining the ground and weighing the grain, this work being done
by a qualified Dominion Land Surveyor, and the results, both
favourable and otherwise, have been fully given.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At each farm about one acre of spring wheat and oats
were sown and harrowed in in the fall when breaking was
done.&nbsp; Much of this grain germinated during the mild weather
of November and December, at which time it showed green above the
ground, and as a consequence it was nearly all killed during the
winter, and the ground had to be resown in spring.&nbsp; Some
small pieces of wheat which were not entirely killed out were
left; and, though the straw showed a rank growth, with heads and
grain much larger than that sown in spring, the crop ripened very
unevenly and much later.&nbsp; Fall sowing of spring wheat, which
has proved successful in Manitoba, is not likely to be a success
in the <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>western country, as the winter is much more mild and
open, and the grain liable to germinate and be killed.&nbsp; Fall
wheat has not, as far as we are aware, been tried, and there
seems no reason why it should not prove successful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The results obtained, considering the manner in which
the land was treated, proved much more satisfactory than was
anticipated, and show&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;1st&mdash;That for grain growing, the land in this
section of country is capable of giving as large a wheat yield
per acre as the heavier lands of Manitoba.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2nd&mdash;That a fair crop can be obtained the first
year of settlement on breaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3rd&mdash;That for fall seeding with spring grain on
the western plains, a satisfactory result cannot be looked for
with any degree of certainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4th&mdash;That cereals, roots, and garden produce <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>can be
successfully raised at an elevation of 3,000 feet above the
sea-level.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5th&mdash;That seeding can be done sufficiently early
to allow of all the crop being harvested before the first of
September.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I hear of many who have done well&mdash;some of whom came
out without a rap&mdash;and who enjoy a robust health unknown to
them at home.</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere has a village so suddenly sprung up into a
city as at Winnipeg, which first obtained notoriety by the advent
of Lord Garnet Wolseley, then a young man, who came to suppress
the rebellion raised there by a half-breed of the name of Riel, a
daring young French Canadian, wily as a savage, brilliant and
energetic.&nbsp; In 1870 he appealed to the prejudices and fears
of the half-breeds, and in a few days had 400 men at his
back.&nbsp; Owing to the clemency&mdash;perhaps mistaken&mdash;of
his captors, Riel escaped the punishment due to his crimes.&nbsp;
In 1873 he was <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>enrolled as a member of Parliament, notwithstanding
that at one time a reward of 5,000 dollars had been offered for
his apprehension as a murderer.</p>
<p>The name of Winnipeg was then little known outside
Manitoba.&nbsp; It was built by traders, who wished to rival Fort
Garrey, then the headquarters of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
and to carry on a free trade on their own account.&nbsp; After
the suppression of the rebellion, Manitoba had a local
Parliament, which met at Winnipeg, and also sent its
representatives to the Dominion Parliament.&nbsp; The place grew
rapidly, though even at that time Mr. Mackenzie, Sir John
Macdonald&rsquo;s political opponent, declared that a cart track
was good enough for Manitoba for many years to come.&nbsp; In
1875 the total population was 3,031 assessed and 2,000
non-assessed, which was a pretty respectable increase,
considering that in 1869 there were hardly a hundred settlers in
the place.&nbsp; As <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>late as 1876 the sport of
wolf-hunting was carried on by several of the inhabitants just
outside the city.&nbsp; Now it has churches, banks, schools,
manufactures, and mercantile men of great energy and high
standing; and has become, especially since the Pacific Railway
Company has made it one of their great stations, the gateway of
the North-West.&nbsp; Settlers came crowding in from all
quarters, and in ten months, in 1878, 600,592 acres of land were
located.&nbsp; In 1879 Winnipeg boasted of a street extension of
83 miles, and then came the bridge over the Red River to render
the town easy of access to all new-comers.&nbsp; Intoxicated with
success, what the Americans call a &lsquo;boom&rsquo; was created
a year or two since, which seemed to have made everyone lose his
wits.&nbsp; There was no end to speculation in town lots;
merchants, tradesmen, professional men, could think of nothing
else.&nbsp; The bottom, however, soon fell out, and at this time
Winnipeg is in rather a depressed state; but <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>it is
clear, from its peculiar position, that this depression can only
be temporary.&nbsp; It is destined to be the great distributing
and railway centre of the vast North-West.&nbsp; The town has now
a population of 26,000, and three daily papers, besides weekly
ones.&nbsp; Ten years hence, it is predicted, she will be ten
times her present size.&nbsp; Her wharves will be lined with
steamboats; her river-banks with elevators; industries and
manufactures will spring up in her midst, and her streets will be
fuller of life than they are to-day.</p>
<p>Winnipeg stands low, and at certain seasons&mdash;that is,
when the thaw commences&mdash;it is liable to floods; but the air
is singularly pure and bracing&mdash;while I write the sky is an
azure blue&mdash;and the hottest days are followed by cool
nights.&nbsp; The inhabitants all seem to be in the possession of
good health.&nbsp; Then the water was said to be bad, whereas I
find it to be quite the reverse.&nbsp; The supply of gas is poor,
and it seems rarely used.&nbsp; The one great drawback is
Winnipeg mud.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>The
streets, all of them, are as broad as Portland Place, only with
handsomer shops.&nbsp; I fear in wet weather they must be almost
impassable.&nbsp; As it is, the sides are now dried up, as if
they were ploughed, and carriages seem to make their way with
considerable difficulty; but there is a magnificent broad wooden
side walk to all the streets, while in the middle sufficient
smoothness has been attained for the due working of street
railways, which seem to be in a satisfactory condition.&nbsp; I
have also been agreeably disappointed with the hotels, which I
was told were all bad and all tremendously dear.&nbsp; On the
contrary, I have found in the new Douglas Hotel, in the main
street, as good accommodation as I require, and at a very
reasonable rate; while the proprietor&mdash;Mr. Bennett, a worthy
Scotchman&mdash;does all he can for the comfort of his guests,
having introduced into this far distant land all the latest
improvements, such as heating the <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>place by steam and the use of
electric bells.</p>
<p>A walk in the city is amusing.&nbsp; Grand shops and
well-built offices everywhere attract the eye.&nbsp; Ladies in
the latest fashion meet you one minute, and the next you jostle a
swarthy Indian, half civilized, and his squaw, still less
civilized than himself.&nbsp; Odd fur-skins are exposed for sale,
while a stuffed bear adorns the main street, up and down which
run all day long the newsboys with the latest telegrams from
London, or Paris, or New York.&nbsp; To-day I have seen a
photograph of the original fireman of the &lsquo;Rocket,&rsquo;
who lives here, and has made a large fortune by contracts.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, at this time he is absent from home, and I fear I
shall not have a chance of interviewing him.&nbsp; Religion
flourishes here.&nbsp; There are about fifteen churches and
chapels in the city, and the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association is in a very successful condition.&nbsp; Of
Protestant <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>bodies, the leading ones are the Presbyterians, the
Methodists, and the Episcopalians.&nbsp; In connection with the
Cathedral of St. Boniface, the oldest church in the city, it is
interesting to note that the bells came originally from
Birmingham, by Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, and that after the destruction
of the building the remains of the metal were gathered up and
sent to Birmingham, whence they have again come back after an
interval of three years.&nbsp; The city stands in the midst of a
fertile plain, adequate to the support of any amount of
population.&nbsp; But the land is far better further on.&nbsp; At
Manitoba, for instance, the soil is much finer.&nbsp; Manitoba is
an Indian name denoting the Voice of God.&nbsp; It seems that the
rocks on the river are cavernous, and that at certain seasons of
the year the wind strikes them with such force as to produce a
singular reverberation, which the rude Indian, whose untutored
mind teaches him to see God in the cloud and hear Him in the
wind, <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>considered to be no less than the utterance of the
Deity Himself.</p>

<p>Just now people are rather exercised with the Indians, who
have been placed in reserves where they cannot get a living, and
who, besides, find their location an unhealthy swamp.&nbsp; One
of the Winnipeg journals is very indignant, and says this is what
may be expected from the Government.&nbsp; From all I can learn,
the Indians are sturdy maintainers of their rights, and take care
that the Government shall not easily overreach them; and perhaps,
on the whole, the Indians are better off under Canadian than they
would be under American government.&nbsp; Indeed, people say they
are very good fellows when uncorrupted by Englishmen.&nbsp; The
emigrant in these parts must not be surprised at the occasional
appearance of an Indian; and perhaps it is well that the farmer
takes care of his horses.&nbsp; I am sorry for the poor Indian,
who is the original owner of the soil, and whom, perhaps, <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>one day Mr.
Henry George may see fit to visit with a view to the recovery of
his rights and the redress of his wrongs.&nbsp; When that is the
case, the emigrant will have to pack up and return to his native
land.&nbsp; Till that is the case, however, he may safely cross
the water, and avail himself of the advantages offered him by the
Dominion Government; but to do that he must have at least
&pound;200, and then he can stock his farm and keep himself till
the return for his labours comes in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The worst of all our books on emigration,&rsquo; said
the editor of one of the dailies to me, &lsquo;is that they give
too glowing an estimate of the state of affairs.&nbsp; They say a
farmer will do well with &pound;100.&nbsp; This is not sufficient
capital as a rule to start with.&nbsp; It is true there have been
instances where settlers have succeeded on this sum, but with
such a sum as &pound;200, Manitoba offers the farmer advantages
such as no other place offers him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here, also, the
regular farm-hand is sure of his living.&nbsp; I see <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>an attempt
is being made by a gentleman, now in Winnipeg, to plant out a
couple of hundred boys&mdash;and I hear there is room for
them.&nbsp; But there is little building going on in Winnipeg,
and the mechanic need not trouble himself to come here.&nbsp; All
in this part are loud in condemnation of emigration from the
East-end of London.&nbsp; Those poor of the East-end&mdash;alas!
neither the Old World nor the New seems to know what to do with
them.&nbsp; Since this was written I see the Manitoba Mortgage
and Investment Company have declared a dividend of eight per
cent., an indication that at any rate in their part of the world
money is being made.</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">LIFE ON THE PRAIRIE.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find Moose Jaw a very pretty place,&rsquo;
said a gentleman to me as I left Winnipeg; and certainly it is a
pretty place, though not exactly according to an
Englishman&rsquo;s idea of prettiness.</p>
<p>It consists of a railway-station and an assemblage of wooden
huts and shops, which have all been called into existence within
the last twelve months.&nbsp; It boasts a weekly organ (such as
it is), two or three places of worship, one or two
billiard-rooms, and a post-office&mdash;not a tent, as in some
parts of the country in which I have been, but a real
wooden-house.&nbsp; The shopkeepers seem to have nothing to do,
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>and the
pigs perambulate the streets, evidently enjoying the fine freedom
allowed them in this part of the world.&nbsp; There are at this
time about 700 or 800 settlers, some of the farmers who came out
last year having moved further west.</p>
<p>I am writing in the railway-station, in the waiting-rooms of
which are many farmers, all on their way to Calgary&mdash;for
which place, also, I am bound, expecting to start at the very
inconvenient hour of two p.m.</p>
<p>The scene, as I sit, is not cheering.&nbsp; Far as the eye can
reach there is the prairie.&nbsp; It was the same all the way
from Winnipeg.&nbsp; It will be the same all the way to Calgary,
some 400 or 500 miles hence.&nbsp; It is intensely hot, and men
and women sit in the open air, under such shade as the wooden
houses afford.&nbsp; It is intensely cold in the winter.&nbsp;
Not a tree is to be seen, or a hill, or a farmhouse; nothing to
relieve the monotony of the sea of grass land on every side,
except <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>here and there a prairie fire&mdash;the first step to
be taken before the farmer commences the cultivation of the soil;
and I must own a prairie fire by night is rather a pretty
sight.</p>
<p>I parted last night with a General and his wife, who have come
to settle about forty miles off.&nbsp; At present he and his
family have no fresh meat, and he has to make an arrangement with
a Brandon butcher, about a hundred and fifty miles off, to supply
him with a Sunday joint.&nbsp; Tinned meats his family have
tried, and he has got with him a fresh joint of meat, which he
purchased in Winnipeg; but there are prairie chickens always to
be had, and in some places, as we came along, we saw an abundance
of wild ducks on the Assiniboine River, and in swamps, over which
we rushed in the Pullman car.</p>
<p>This luxury cannot be expected in Moose Jaw.&nbsp; Here there
is no water at all.&nbsp; Last year the farmers had no rain, and
they fear they will have none now.&nbsp; As it is, the <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>prairie
begins to look a little scorched.&nbsp; I should be loth to spend
the remainder of my days here; but a farmer may make a living,
and so may a farm-labourer.&nbsp; As to any other class of people
here, there is no opening at all.&nbsp; The town is full of
shopkeepers, barristers, auctioneers, and dealers.&nbsp;
Mechanics who come out will starve.&nbsp; When the land around is
taken up they will have a chance, but not till then.</p>
<p>As I sit, a dark figure beckons me to come to him.&nbsp; He
has a Jim Crow hat, a blanket around his martial form, and a
gayer one in front.&nbsp; He has rings in his ears, bracelets on
his arms, and a string of some kind of beads around his
neck.&nbsp; He offers me his hand, and I shake it.&nbsp; Then I
commence a conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;What you called?&rsquo; I
say.&nbsp; He makes an unintelligible reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
Smith, or Brown, or Jones, or Robinson?&rsquo; I ask; and again
he gives an unintelligent grunt.&nbsp; I offer him a cigar, and
he sits down on his <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>haunches in the shade.&nbsp; He is
one of the Black Bull men, who have been chased from the States,
in consequence of having made that part of the world too hot for
them.&nbsp; They are not natives of this country, but have
settled in the prairie two or three miles off.&nbsp; I tell him
to be a good boy, and I dare say he will obey my injunction as
literally as any other man in England or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Again I look, and two red-coated warriors greet me.&nbsp; They
are on the look-out for contraband, and are as fine and clean and
well-set fellows as any I have seen anywhere.&nbsp; They belong
to the mounted police, and live chiefly in the saddle, as there
are but five hundred of them to all this gigantic
North-West.&nbsp; I had already made their acquaintance.&nbsp; At
the first station we came to after leaving Manitoba, one of them
came into the car, gave a searching glance all round, and then
walked out.&nbsp; &lsquo;What was that for?&rsquo; I asked the
General.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! he has come to see if we <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>have any
whisky.&nbsp; They are very particular.&nbsp; I was coming this
way once, when a fellow traveller took out his pocket flask and
began drinking.&nbsp; The mounted policeman who saw him do it
immediately took his flask from him, and emptied it there and
then.&rsquo;&nbsp; This strict prohibition is the result, not of
the prevalence of Temperance sentiment in the North-West, but
rather of fear of the Indians, who are better shots than the
mounted police, although not so well provided with
fire-arms.&nbsp; The people seem to anticipate that the law will
be relaxed when the whites are more numerous and the Indians
fewer.&nbsp; The law has had good results, nevertheless.&nbsp; In
obedience to it the German gives up his lager-beer.&nbsp; And
next to the Scotch the Germans make the best emigrants.</p>
<p>The General tells me such is the fineness of the climate that
he finds he can get on very well without his customary glass of
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>grog.&nbsp; At Moose Jaw the inhabitants take to Hop
Bitters instead, and one of the institutions of the place is the
Hop Bitters Brewery.</p>
<p>I believe you may keep whisky if you get a permit, and a
permit is not difficult, I understand, to get.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say the General, in spite of the mounted police,
offered me a drop of whisky, and at a later period a friend, as
we sat smoking, asked me if I was ready for a
&lsquo;smile.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course, in my ignorance, I replied
in the affirmative.&nbsp; Diving under his seat, he brought out a
fine bottle of real Scotch, and, mixing it with water, offered me
a &lsquo;smile.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may be sure I indignantly
refused.&nbsp; You cannot expect me to be a party to the
violation of the law.</p>
<p>These Indians just now are creating a little apprehension,
especially the tribe under the renowned Yellow Calf, who it was
hoped had taken to farming, and who last year had <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>a good
crop, and bought a reaping machine; but the Indians are very
restless, and Yellow Calf has sent a messenger to rouse the
tribes, and a strong party of the mounted police are detached to
watch his movements.&nbsp; They are dying off the face of the
earth, and we may well suppose that they bear no love to the
white man, who has taken possession of the lands which they once
knew to be their own.&nbsp; Here the people evidently think that
the sooner the Indians are exterminated the better.&nbsp; The men
do not work; all that is done by the squaws&mdash;wretched women
with long black hair, and little black eyes as round as beads,
and who rejoice in blankets quite as unromantic, but quite as
comfortable, as those of their lords and masters.&nbsp; Hitherto,
I have not made way with the dusky beauties, but I may be more
successful by-and-by.</p>
<p>I believe the Indians have a real grievance against the
Canadian Government.&nbsp; It was <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>agreed that they should be settled
in reserves, and that they should have a certain amount of food
supplied.&nbsp; This compact was fairly observed by the Canadian
Government; but in an evil hour they made this part of their duty
over to contractors, and we know what contractors are, all the
world over.&nbsp; The Indians say faith has not been kept with
them, and it is to be feared that they have good reason for
saying so.&nbsp; Just now they are starving, as this is the close
season, and they are not permitted to hunt or fish.&nbsp; They
say that there is no close season as far as the stomach is
concerned, and from personal experience I may say I believe they
are right.</p>
<p>It is now noon on the prairie, and I am dying of the
heat.&nbsp; Oh, for the forest shade!&nbsp; Oh, for the crystal
stream!&nbsp; Alas! the water here is not good for the stranger,
and I fear to touch it.&nbsp; At Toronto I managed pretty well on
Apollinaris water; but out here <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>nothing of the kind is to be
had.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; The beef here is so tough that
you can&rsquo;t cut it with a knife, and must have belonged to
the oldest importation from my native land; and I have to pay a
price for which I can have a luxurious repast in London.&nbsp; O
Spiers and Pond!&nbsp; O Gordon and Co.!&nbsp; O respected Ring
and Brymer, under whose juicy joints and sparkling wines the
ancient Corporation of London renews its youth!&nbsp; How my soul
longs for your flesh-pots in this dry and thirsty land, where no
water is!&nbsp; I have been out on the prairie under the burning
sun.&nbsp; It is cracked, and parched, and bare, and the flowers
refuse to bloom, and only the gigantic grasshopper or the pretty
but repulsive snake meets my eye.&nbsp; That dim line, protracted
to the horizon east and west, is the railroad.&nbsp; That far-off
collection of sheds is the rising town of Moose Jaw.&nbsp; That
blue line on the horizon, which makes me pant for the sea, is a
mirage.&nbsp; Far off are <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>some white tents glistening in the
sun.&nbsp; They are the wigwams of the Indians.</p>
<p>Like the Wandering Jew, again I urge on my wild career, and
here I am with noble savages&mdash;so hideous that words fail to
tell their hideousness.&nbsp; No wonder the squaws are
bashful.&nbsp; They have little to be proud of, though they have
necklaces and rings and ornaments around their belts, and gay
shawls, which have come from some far away factory.&nbsp; Some of
them have put a streak of red paint where the black hair
divides.&nbsp; Others are painted as much as any Dowager of
Mayfair, and have ear ornaments that reach down to the
middle.&nbsp; Not one is fairly passable.</p>
<p>Rousseau and the sentimentalists, who talk of the savage,
greatly err in their estimate of that noble individual.&nbsp; He
is lazy and filthy, gluttonous, and would be a wine-bibber had he
the chance.&nbsp; I looked into his tent, and there he was
sitting naked, whilst his squaw was cooking a bit of a horse with
the hair on <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>for his dinner.&nbsp; He is unpleasant as a neighbour
for many reasons, and is indifferent how he gets a dollar, or how
his squaw earns it either.&nbsp; All along the prairie he seems
to have nothing to do but to rush to the nearest railway station,
and sit there all day in the hope that some passing traveller may
give him tobacco or cash, the only two things on earth he seems
to care for.&nbsp; Apparently, the mothers are fond of their
young.&nbsp; The men are clever at stealing horses, and the
traveller must look after his horses by night, or he may find
them, as friends of my own did, gone in the morning.&nbsp; But to
return to the prairie, it is an awful place to travel in alone;
it is so easy to lose one&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; I heard wonderful
stories in this respect.&nbsp; Fancy being lost on the prairie;
nothing but the grass to eat; nothing but the sky to look at;
nothing in the shape of human speech to listen to.&nbsp; Out here
by myself, I felt more than once how appropriate the language of
the poet beloved by our grandmothers:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&lsquo;O Solitude, where are the charms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sages have seen in thy face?<br />
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than reign in this horrible place.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a good deal of hardship to be encountered by any who
would penetrate to the dim and mysterious region we denominate
the North-West.&nbsp; For instance, I left Moose Jaw at half-past
two yesterday morning by a train timed to arrive there at a
quarter-past one; at which unreasonable hour I had to leave my
bed, just as I was getting into a sound sleep, and to catch the
train, which was so crowded that I could scarcely get a seat, and
the atmosphere of which was not redolent of the odours of Araby
the Blest.&nbsp; There I had to sit till the time I mention, as
the engine managed to get off the line.&nbsp; Deeply do I pity
the poor emigrants tempted into this part of the world by the
delusive utterances of sham emigration agents at home and local
journals&mdash;which, when they are not abusing one another, seem
to delight in giving representations of <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the country
by no means literally to be depended on; the only thing to do is
to go to the fountain head&mdash;the Government office.&nbsp;
People who make up their minds to come into these parts must
learn to put up with a good deal.&nbsp; Here is a sad case, a
very exceptional one, I admit, but I am bound to tell the whole
truth.&nbsp; I quote from a Winnipeg paper: &lsquo;David
Kirkpatrick, his wife, and nine children, the eldest a girl of
twelve, arrived from Scotland on Wednesday.&nbsp; A part of the
voyage was made on board the <i>Algoma</i>.&nbsp; The cold was
intense, and many of the passengers suffered severely.&nbsp;
Among these was Mrs. Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; The exposure, in her
case, brought on a kind of low fever, and the poor woman died
yesterday morning.&nbsp; The husband&rsquo;s case is
deplorable.&nbsp; With nine children on his hands, what is he to
do?&nbsp; He has a longing desire to get back to his friends in
Scotland, but has not the means.&nbsp; Will the public come to
his rescue?&nbsp; He and his helpless <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>children are to be found in the
immigrant sheds.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fear such cases are far from
uncommon.&nbsp; Imagine a poor woman leaving her native land,
crossing the restless Atlantic, perhaps feeble with poor living,
and worried with the care of nine helpless children, perhaps
scarce recovered from sea-sickness, put on board an emigrant
train, snatching hasty meals, or such accommodation as is
provided at the expense of Dominion Government (I do not blame
them or the railway authorities, they do all they can),
travelling at uncertain hours, and arriving at her destination
utterly overcome by fatigue.&nbsp; What wonder is it that a poor
woman now and then sacrifices her life in the attempt to build up
a new home in this Promised Land?&nbsp; No wonder that now and
then death comes to such just as they reach Jordan and think that
they are to reap the fruit of all their weary toil.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As I left Brandon on my way hither I saw by the side of one of
the stations quite a little <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>village of tents.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
is that?&rsquo; said I to one of the mounted police.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The emigrants,&rsquo; was his reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;They do
say,&rsquo; said he slowly, &lsquo;that there is some sickness
amongst them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whether the rumour was founded on fact
I had no time to inquire, but certainly, when one thinks of the
hardships of the emigrants&rsquo; lot, and the peculiar unfitness
of many of them to stand hardships, I should not be surprised to
learn that such was the case.&nbsp; The further I come out, the
less demand I find for emigrants.&nbsp; It is only ploughmen who
are wanted here.&nbsp; The man who will succeed is the farmer
with a small capital.&nbsp; He has a splendid chance.&nbsp; When
the country is settled the mechanic may have his turn.</p>
<p>But remember, after all has been said and done, this is the
Great Lone Land.&nbsp; Emigration here is but a drop in the ocean
as regards results.&nbsp; I am now some 850 miles to the
north-west of Winnipeg.&nbsp; The <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>country is an unbroken level, and,
with the exception of Brandon and Moose Jaw, you see hardly a
farmhouse, hardly any ploughed land, no sheep grazing on the
downs, no herds fattening in the prairie; not a single tree to
hide one from the snows of winter or the suns of summer.&nbsp; By
day you melt in the sun, by night you shiver with the cold.&nbsp;
When we came to a swamp now and then we saw a few wild
ducks.&nbsp; Once in the course of the weary ride we saw two or
three deer.&nbsp; All the rest was a parched plain, with here and
there some lovely flowers, and with buffalo bones bleaching
wherever you turn your eye.&nbsp; In some parts the soil was
strongly impregnated with alkali, so much so, indeed, that it
made the ground white, and left a crust of what looked like ice
on the lakes and ponds.&nbsp; Can that huge region ever grow
wheat and fatten flocks?&nbsp; The experience of the experimental
farms proves that it will.&nbsp; All I know is that ages must
elapse before Moose <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Jaw shall be a Manchester, or
Brandon, in spite of its many advantages, the headquarters of the
agricultural interest, with a corn market equalling that of
Norwich or Ipswich.&nbsp; Yet there are parts of Manitoba which
contain undoubtedly as fine corn-growing country as any in the
world.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the new tract of country opened up
by the Canadian Pacific in the south-west.&nbsp; As a rule, the
further from the railway the land is, the better it is.&nbsp; At
the same time, it is to be remembered that a farmer who has no
railway access is at a great disadvantage, and that in the winter
it is no joke sending a man with a team of oxen and a waggon-load
of produce twenty or thirty miles across the prairie, where a
snowstorm, or &lsquo;a blorrard&rsquo; at any time, may
occur.</p>
<p>This is the great drawback of Manitoba: it has no trees.&nbsp;
In Ontario the farmer has his crops protected by a belt of trees
from <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the
inclemency of the weather.&nbsp; But, then, in Manitoba the
farmer has this advantage, that he has not to devote the greater
part of his time and money to the cutting down of his
trees.&nbsp; He has only to plough the soil, and there is an
abundant harvest.&nbsp; If Manitoba lacks trees, it is expected
to yield a plentiful supply of coal.&nbsp; As I came along last
night we saw a station supplied with gas.&nbsp; It appears that
in boring for water they discovered gas, which they now utilize
to light the station and to work a steam engine.&nbsp; This was
not, however, in Manitoba, but in Alberta, just after we had left
Medicine Hat, that pretty oasis in the desert, with the usual
supply of hotels, billiard-rooms, and stores, and where I came
into contact with the Cree Indians, a race even uglier than the
Sioux Indian, whom I found at Moose Jaw.&nbsp; They have higher
cheekbones, and don&rsquo;t plait their hair, and some of the old
men reminded me not a little in outline of <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the late
Lord Beaconsfield, whom the Canadians consider Sir John Macdonald
strongly resembles.</p>
<p>It is curious to note how the buffalo has vanished from the
region which was formerly his happy hunting-ground.&nbsp; He has
now forsaken the country; you see only his bones and his
track.&nbsp; Some people say that the railway has done it, and
others that the destruction is the work of the Americans, who
say, &lsquo;Kill the buffalo and you get rid of the
Indians.&rsquo;&nbsp; These latter are to be met with everywhere,
clad in flannel garments radiant with all the hues of the
rainbow.&nbsp; Chiefly they affect blankets&mdash;red, blue, or
green.&nbsp; At Calgary I came across more of them&mdash;this
time of the Blackfoot tribe.&nbsp; There is very little
difference in any of them.&nbsp; In one thing they all resemble
each other, that is, they don&rsquo;t seem to care much about
work.&nbsp; As English does not happen to be one of their
accomplishments, my intercourse with <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>them has been of a somewhat limited
character.</p>
<p>For the sake of intending emigrants let me dispel a couple of
popular errors.&nbsp; One that the heat is most enjoyable;
another, that it is a cheap country to come to.&nbsp; Neither
assertion is exactly the truth.&nbsp; As I write the heat is
insufferable, and yet this is early spring.&nbsp; I saw snow
yesterday in a hollow of the hills not yet melted, and last
night, sleeping in a stuffy Pullman car full of people, I was
awoke with the cold.&nbsp; The other fallacy which I would expose
is that this is a cheap country.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is
nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Paxton Hood, if I remember aright,
once gave a lecture on America under the title of the &lsquo;Land
of the Big Dollar.&rsquo;&nbsp; If I were to lecture on Canada I
should call it the &lsquo;Land of the Little Dollar.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A dollar here is of no account.&nbsp; This morning I went into a
shop and had a bottle of ginger-beer, and the cost was one <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>shilling;
and this, too, after I had been administering a little
&lsquo;soft sawder&rsquo; to the fair American damsel who waited
on me (she was from Michigan, and was remarkably wide awake), in
the mistaken hope that she would be a little reasonable in her
charge.&nbsp; Everyone smokes cigars all day long, and yet
Canadian cigars are as costly as they are atrocious.&nbsp;
Fortunately one can&rsquo;t spend money in drink, as that is
prohibited, and the chemists at Calgary have recently got into a
scrape for supplying customers with essence of lemon, by means of
which they manage to fuddle themselves.&nbsp; The price of fruit
is prohibitory; cucumbers, such as you in London would give three
halfpence for, are here at Calgary as much as a shilling.&nbsp;
Eggs are four shillings a dozen; meat and bacon and ham are as
dear as in England, and not a quarter so good.&nbsp; I am
appalled as I see how the money goes; I fear to be stranded at
the foot of the Rockies.&nbsp; <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>If I get back to the west I shall
have to work my passage back to England as fireman or stoker, or
in some such ignoble capacity.&nbsp; If I was younger I would
turn gardener.&nbsp; I believe anyone who would come out here
with sufficient capital to plant a nursery ground or to stock a
good fruit garden would make a lot of money, as the farmers, of
course, do not think of such things, and the supply is quite
unequal to the demand.&nbsp; In Calgary they did not have three
inches of frost all last winter.&nbsp; It is true they have even
now a sharp nip of frost; but I hear of peas flourishing at a
farmer&rsquo;s close by, and the region abounds with wild
strawberries and raspberries and cherries.&nbsp; If they grow
wild, surely they will equally prosper under more careful
culture.</p>
<p>A Special Committee of the Dominion House of Commons which was
appointed last session to obtain evidence upon the agricultural
industries of the country, examined <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>several witnesses as to the
suitability of Canada, and especially of the Canadian North-West,
for the growth of forest and fruit trees.&nbsp; The testimony
given showed that there are many varieties of fruit which thrive
in Great Britain, Germany, Russia, and other European countries,
which would, if transplanted, be equally suited to the climate of
the North-West, it being stated that excellent fruit is grown in
great quantities in Europe at points where the temperature ranges
considerably lower than it does in Canada.&nbsp; It is urged that
the example of the Russian and German Governments should be
followed in the establishment of plantations of fruit trees and
experimental farms in different parts of the Dominion, to test
the kind of trees and fruits best suited to the different
localities.</p>
<p>Since my return the following paper has been put into my
hands:&mdash;&lsquo;The following is a reliable estimate of this
season&rsquo;s wheat crop <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>in Manitoba and the North-West
Territories:&mdash;Estimated wheat acreage in Manitoba, 350,000;
yield at 23 bushels per acre, 8,000,000; estimated wheat acreage
in North-West Territories, 65,000; yield at 23 bushels per acre,
or 1,500,000 bushels&mdash;a total of 415,000 acres and 9,500,000
bushels.&nbsp; Deducting 2,760,000 bushels for home consumption
and seed, a surplus remains of 6,740,000 bushels.&nbsp;
Everything now points to a larger yield per acre than that of
1883.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Operations have been carried on very extensively this
season at the Bell Farm, in the Canadian North-West, which is
said to be the largest farm in the world.&nbsp; Though this is
but the second year of cultivation, there are already 8,000 acres
under crop, 5,000 to 6,000 of which are under wheat, and a
portion of the remainder under flax.&nbsp; Last year 10,000
bushels were exported from the farm, and the excellence of the
grain secured for it a good price in the market.&nbsp; The crop
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>of this
year is estimated to be 40 per cent. better.&nbsp; Experts from
Montana who have recently visited this section of the Canadian
North-West, state that they never saw any grain in the United
States to equal that on and around the Bell Farm.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">AMONGST THE COW-BOYS.</p>
<p>I am writing from Calgary, a little but growing collection of
huts and wooden houses planted on a lovely plain with hills all
around, a river at my feet, on the banks of which some poplars
flourish, and I can almost fancy I am in Derbyshire itself.&nbsp;
It is a gay place, this rising town, at the foot, as it were, of
the Rockies, and just now is unusually gay, as the Queen&rsquo;s
birthday is being celebrated with athletic sports and a ball;
and, besides, a new clergyman has made his appearance, the Rev.
Parks Smith, from a Bermondsey parish, who is to preach in the
new Assembly Hall, which is to be set apart as a church on <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>Sundays.&nbsp; I am going to hear him, and already I
feel somewhat of a Pharisee&mdash;I have on a clean collar, which
I religiously preserved for the occasion, and have had my boots
blackened.&nbsp; The sight is so novel that I have spent half an
hour on the prairie contemplating the effect of that
operation.&nbsp; Already I feel six inches higher.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I think quite so much of Calgary as do
the people who live in it.&nbsp; In splendour, in wealth, in
dignity, and importance, they evidently anticipate it will be a
second Babylon.&nbsp; Well, a good deal has to be done
first.&nbsp; The situation is pleasant, I admit.&nbsp; You
incline to think well of Calgary after the dreary ride across the
prairie, and you have quite a choice of hotels, and of shops, all
well stocked; but then these shops are little better than huts,
and the hotels certainly don&rsquo;t throw the shops into the
shade.</p>
<p>For instance, I am in the leading hotel.&nbsp; It is too far
from the railway, but that is because <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>the C.P.R. have moved their station
a little further on, where the new town of Calgary is springing
up.&nbsp; We have an open room, where I am writing&mdash;a dark
dining-room on one side, and then, on the other, a little row of
closets, which they dignify by the name of bedrooms.&nbsp; I am
the proud possessor of one.&nbsp; It holds a bed, whereon, I own,
I slept soundly; a row of pegs, on which to hang one&rsquo;s
clothes; and a little shelf, on which is placed a tiny wash-hand
basin; while above that is a glass, in which it is impossible to
get a good view of yourself&mdash;a matter of very small
consequence, as the glass certainly reflects very poorly the
looker&rsquo;s personal charms, whatever they may be.&nbsp; I
ought to have said there is a window; and as my bedroom is on the
ground floor (upper rooms are rare in these wooden houses in the
North-West), I am much exercised in my mind as to whether that
window may not be opened in the course of the night, and the roll
of <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>dollars I have hidden under my pillow carried
off.&nbsp; Then, just as I am getting into bed, I discover
somebody else&rsquo;s boots.&nbsp; That is
awkward&mdash;very.&nbsp; It is with a sigh of relief I discover
that they are not feminine.&nbsp; Suppose the owner of those
boots comes into my bedroom and claims to be the rightful
owner?&nbsp; Suppose he resorts to physical force?&nbsp; Suppose,
in such a case, I got the worst of it?</p>
<p>Fortunately, before I can answer these questions
satisfactorily to myself, I am asleep, and yet they are not so
irrelevant as you fancy.</p>
<p>Last night, for instance, as I was sitting in the cool air,
smoking one of the peculiarly bad cigars in which the brave men
of Canada greatly rejoice, and for which they pay as heavily as
if they were of the finest brands, a half-drunken man came up,
abusing me in every possible way, threatening to smash every bone
in my body, and altogether behaving himself in a way the reverse
of polite.&nbsp; <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Perhaps you say, Why did you not knock him down?&nbsp;
In novels heroes always do, and come clear off; but I am not
writing fiction, and in real life I have always found discretion
to be the better part of valour.&nbsp; The fact is, the fellow
was a strapping Hercules, and I could see in a moment, if the
appeal were to force, what the issue might be.&nbsp; Yet I had
not done anything intentionally to offend him.&nbsp; He had come
galloping up to the hotel, as they all do here&mdash;the horses
are not trained to trot&mdash;and his horse had bucked him
off.&nbsp; I believe I did say something to a friend of a mildly
critical nature, but I question whether the rider heard it.&nbsp;
The fact was, he was angry at having been thrown, and seeing that
I was a stranger, he evidently thought he could pour the vials of
his wrath on me.&nbsp; I must admit that in a little while he
came up and apologized, and there was an end of the matter.&nbsp;
But the worst part of it was that his friend remarked to me that
this drunken <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>insulting ruffian was one of the best fellows in the
place.&nbsp; If so, Calgary has to be thankful for very small
mercies indeed.</p>
<p>You ask, How could the fellow be drunk, seeing that there is a
prohibitory liquor-law in existence?&nbsp; I have every reason to
believe that Calgary is a very drunken place, nevertheless.&nbsp;
I have already referred to one case of drunkenness.&nbsp; I may
add that, in the afternoon of the same day, I had seen another in
the shape of an old gentleman who was going to head a revolt
which would cut off the North-West from the Dominion, and which
would make her a Crown colony.&nbsp; He was very drunk as he
stood on the bar opposite me declaiming all this bunkum.&nbsp; I
remarked his state to the landlord, who seemed to feel how unfair
it was that men could get drunk on the sly, and that a decent
landlord, like himself, should be deprived of the privilege of
selling them decent liquor.&nbsp; I own it is very hard on the
publicans.&nbsp; At Moose <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Jaw one of them told me he would
give five hundred pounds for a liquor license.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
call this a free country,&rsquo; said an indignant English
settler to me, &lsquo;and yet I can&rsquo;t get a drop of good
liquor.&nbsp; Pretty freedom, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the Government, while it prohibits the sale of
liquor, does not exterminate the desire for it&mdash;perhaps only
increases it&mdash;as we always cry for what we can&rsquo;t
get.&nbsp; Unfortunately, also, it is true that, as long as this
demand exists, the supply will be found somehow.</p>
<p>In Montana there are a lot of blackguards and daredevils who
will run the thing in somehow.&nbsp; Liquor is also brought in by
the railway as coal-oil, oatmeal, flour, varnish, and then it is
doctored up and sold at &pound;1 the bottle to the thirsty
souls.&nbsp; Now, what is the consequence?&nbsp; Why, that, as a
local journal remarks, liquor is sold; the dealers are pests and
outlaws; they sell their poison for ten times the price of what
people who don&rsquo;t <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>belong to the Blue Ribbon Army call
good liquor, and then vanish with their ill-gotten money out of
the country, excepting such as they may leave behind them in the
shape of fines, when found out.&nbsp; I do think the hotel-keeper
has much reason to complain of prohibition.&nbsp; It presses
hardly on him, and does not put drunkenness down.&nbsp; I
mentioned these facts to a Baptist minister from England, whom I
met in Toronto.&nbsp; He would not believe them; I gave him
cuttings from newspapers to support my view.&nbsp; His reply was
that they were hoaxes.&nbsp; I have now been in Calgary a day,
and already I find that these hoaxes, as my friend calls them,
are veritable facts.</p>
<p>I believe that many of my travelling companions were a little
fresh last night, from their soberness and dejection of manner
this morning.&nbsp; They were away down town, and had not
returned when I retired to rest; and this morning several of the
householders complain <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>of having had their doors knocked at
at most unseasonable hours.</p>
<p>At meals I meet queer company.&nbsp; We have a Chinese
cook.&nbsp; I have a faint idea that he has murderous designs on
us all, his smile is so childlike and bland; yet I prefer his
placid pleasant round face to those of his female helps, sour and
ill-looking, who earn wages such as an English servant-girl never
dreams of.&nbsp; His messes seem to be appreciated, and little is
left after meal-time.&nbsp; It is enough for me to see the men
eat.&nbsp; Every particle of food is conveyed into the mouth by
means of the knife, which is also freely used if sugar or salt be
required.&nbsp; Our dining-room is simply a shed, and a very dark
one, having a canvas on one side and unpainted deal on the
other.&nbsp; Few houses at Calgary are painted, though a painted
house looks so much prettier than a deal one that I wonder
painting is not more resorted to, especially when you remember
how paint <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>preserves the wood.&nbsp; Many of the houses here are
brought all the way from Ontario, and, perhaps, this accounts for
their smallness.&nbsp; They chiefly consist of two rooms, one a
shop, the other a sitting and night-room; and the larger number
have been erected within the last few months.&nbsp; What we call
in England a gentleman&rsquo;s house, I should say does not exist
in the whole district.&nbsp; A gentleman would find existence
intolerable here, though the air is fine, and the extent of the
prairie is unbounded.&nbsp; There are two newspapers in the town,
and the professions are all well represented.</p>
<p>As to my companions, the less I say of them the better.&nbsp;
They are young and vigorous, and use language not generally
tolerated in polite society.&nbsp; Their talk is chiefly of
horses and bets.&nbsp; They ride recklessly up and down the dusty
path which forms the main street, and would not break their
hearts if they knocked a fellow down; or they drive light <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>waggons on
four wheels, creating the most overwhelming clouds of dust as
they rush by.&nbsp; As to their saddles, they are as unlike
English ones as can well be imagined, rising at each end, so as
to give the rider a very safe seat, while their stirrups are as
long almost as the foot itself; but the saddles have this
advantage, that they never give the horses sore backs.&nbsp; As
to the horses, they are all branded, and turned loose on to the
prairie when not required.&nbsp; Most of the men are
prospectors&mdash;people who go round the country in search of
mines; or cow-boys&mdash;that is, men employed in the cattle
ranches in the district.&nbsp; The cowboy is a fearful
sight.&nbsp; His hands and face are as brown as leather, he wears
a straw hat&mdash;or one of felt&mdash;with a very wide
brim.&nbsp; His coat or jacket is, perhaps, decorated with Indian
work.&nbsp; Around his waist he wears a belt, which he makes
useful in many ways.&nbsp; Then he has brown leather leggings,
ornamented down the sides with leather fringes, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and on his
heels he puts a tremendous pair of spurs.&nbsp; The men on the
mountains have much the same style of dress, and are fine
specimens of muscular, rather than intellectual or moral,
development.&nbsp; On the whole, I am not unduly enamoured of
these pioneers of civilization; but, then, I was born in the old
country, and learned Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns, and was taught
to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thank the goodness and the grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That on my birth has smiled,<br />
And made me in these Christian days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A happy English child.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see a good deal more of Calgary than I wish to.&nbsp; I feel
that I have been made a fool of by the station-master.&nbsp; I
am, as you may be aware, at the foot of the Rocky
Mountains.&nbsp; They are some 60 miles off, yet; already I have
seen their far-off peaks, glistening with snow, rising into the
summer sky.&nbsp; As I have got so far, I must see them.&nbsp;
There are trees up there, and the sight of a <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>tree would
be good for sore eyes; there are cooling shades out there, and
here, though it is but early morning, it is too hot to
stir.&nbsp; The scenery out there is the finest to be seen in all
the Canadian continent, and I would carry away with me, to think
of in after years, something of their beauty.&nbsp; I travelled
all this way for that purpose, and hoped to have been off before,
and now find I must wait, owing to a blunder on the part of the
station-master.&nbsp; He promised he would let me know if he sent
a freight-train to the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; Well, he sent off a
train at one o&rsquo;clock this morning, and never let me know
anything about it, and the consequence is I must stay two more
days in this dreary spot, without conveniences such as I could
find in the meanest cottage in England, and at a cost which would
enable me to live in luxury and fare sumptuously at home.&nbsp;
One lesson I have learned, which I repeat for the benefit of my
readers.&nbsp; Never <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>depend upon other people; hear all
they say, and then act for yourself.&nbsp; Had I done so, I
should have been now in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; I trusted in
others, and I am, in consequence, the victim of misplaced
confidence.</p>
<p>I gather a few items of interest to intending emigrants.&nbsp;
Crops raised in the vicinity of Calgary during 1883 gave the
following yields per acre:&mdash;Wheat, 33 bushels; barley, 40
bushels; oats, 60 bushels.&nbsp; The Government farm a few miles
off, which I have visited, does well.&nbsp; The country round
offers especial advantages to sheep and dairy farmers, cheese
manufacturers, and hog raisers.&nbsp; My own impression is, and I
have mentioned it to several persons who all think it excellent,
that any man would easily make his fortune who set up a poultry
farm.&nbsp; Eggs and fowls are almost entirely unknown, and if
the producer did not find a market here, he could easily send his
produce by the railway to where it was wanted.&nbsp; Eggs and
fowls <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>help one as well as anything to keep body and soul
together.</p>
<p>I am glad I went to church yesterday.&nbsp; My presence there
gave quite a tone to the place (said the head man to me this
morning), and so far I may presume I did good service.&nbsp; The
congregation consisted chiefly of men, and the collection
amounted to nearly 16 dollars&mdash;pretty good, considering
(said the above mentioned gentleman) there are two or three
schism shops in the place.&nbsp; In the evening I went to the
Wesleyan Methodist schism shop, as he called it, and heard a
sermon, which touched me more than any sermon I have heard a long
time.&nbsp; As I came out the effect was startling.&nbsp; The sun
was sinking in crimson glory just behind the green hills by which
Calgary is surrounded.&nbsp; Far off a dim splendour of pink
testified to the existence of a prairie fire, while before me
stood a gigantic Indian, with his big black head rising out of a
pyramid of gorgeous robes, <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>really dazzling to behold.&nbsp;
There is an Indian Mission near here, but the Indians are not the
only heathens out here.</p>
<p>I have just had a ride in a buck-cart, which is the kind of
vehicle the colonists use.&nbsp; It is of boards on four wheels,
on which is placed a seat for a couple of persons, while the
luggage is piled up behind.&nbsp; Some of them have springs, as
fortunately was the case with the one on which I rode, or I
should have had a very uncomfortable ride indeed.&nbsp; Perhaps I
ought not to be so angry with the station-master as I was when I
interviewed him this morning.&nbsp; I have just seen a man who
got on to the freight train, but he tells me it was so
uncomfortable that he preferred to wait, and got off after he had
taken his passage.</p>
<p>Money seems scarce.&nbsp; I have just been to the post-office
to send a letter to England.&nbsp; The postmaster could give me
no change, and I had to take post-cards instead.&nbsp; I <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>suppose all
the money goes to the smugglers.&nbsp; In this small town 500
dollars are sent weekly to Winnipeg for liquor; so much for
prohibition in Calgary.</p>
<p>As there is no bank here, people find it hard to get
money.&nbsp; A young man waiting here to make up a mining party
for the Rockies, tells me he had to telegraph to Toronto for 500
dollars, which were sent in the shape of a post-office
order.&nbsp; The postmaster charged him five dollars for cashing
the order.&nbsp; I have just heard of a loan of 300 dollars
effected; the borrower has agreed to pay, in the shape of
interest, the moderate sum of four dollars a month.</p>
<p>Calgary, according to some, can have no enduring prosperity;
if so, the land-grabbers who have scattered themselves all over
it will be deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>Edmonton, where they get gold out of the river sand, and where
they have already a kind of dredging machine employed for that <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>purpose, it
is said, will shortly have a railway to itself, and the men from
the mountains, who are the mainstay of Calgary, will go that
way.</p>
<p>I fancy I hear some one exclaim: On those wide plains over
which sweeps the ice-laden air of the Rockies, what pleasant
walks you must have!&nbsp; My dear sir, you are quite
mistaken.&nbsp; Perhaps, as you set out, there comes a herd of
wild horses&mdash;and then I remember how poor George Moore was
knocked down by one, and avoid the boundless prairie
accordingly.</p>
<p>Then there are the dogs, &lsquo;their name is Legion,&rsquo;
and they are big, and as wild as they are big, and I am not
partial to hydrophobia.&nbsp; No; it is better to sit at the door
of my tent and watch the flight of the horses, the fights of the
dogs, and the stream of dust a mile long which denotes that some
Jehu is at hand, who will pull up at the door, deeply drink
water, smoke a cigar, use a little <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>strong language, and then mount
again and ride off into boundless space.</p>
<p>Here and there a pedestrian may be seen making his way to his
solitary hut or shop, where at no time do you see any sign of
life; and how the people here make a living (with the exception
of the hotel-keepers, who are always busy) puzzles me.&nbsp; I
meet good fellows, I own.&nbsp; They are friendly in their
way.&nbsp; As humour is a thing unknown in Canada and the
North-West, they generally grin when I make a remark, which I do
at very protracted intervals, fearing to be worn out before the
long day is done.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I begin to doubt whether I
am not relapsing into the wild life of those around me.&nbsp;
Fortunately, I have not yet acquired the habit of speaking
through my nose, nor do I make that fearful sound&mdash;a hawking
in the throat&mdash;which is a signal that your neighbour is
preparing to expectorate, and which renders travelling, even in a
first-class car, <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>almost insupportable; but my hands are tanned.&nbsp; I
sit with my waistcoat open, and occasionally in my
shirt-sleeves.&nbsp; I care little to make any effort to be
polite; I am clean forgetting all my manners, and feel that in a
little while I shall be as rough as a cow-boy, or as the wild
wolf of the prairie.&nbsp; It is clear I must not tarry at
Calgary too long.</p>

194</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">IN THE ROCKIES&mdash;HOLT CITY&mdash;LIFE IN
THE CAMP&mdash;A ROUGH RIDE&mdash;THE KICKING HORSE
LAKE&mdash;BRITISH COLUMBIA.</p>
<p>I am writing from Holt City&mdash;so named after a famous
contractor out here&mdash;in the middle of the Rocky
Mountains.&nbsp; Here the rail comes, but no further, as yet,
though some 2,000 men are at work a few miles ahead, and making
incredible speed in the construction of this gigantic
intercolonial undertaking&mdash;an undertaking which would have
been completed by this time had the late Sir Hugh Allan (the
founder of the Allan line of steamers) and Sir John Macdonald had
their way.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>I
left Calgary without shedding a tear&mdash;the train was only
three hours late&mdash;after remarking to the manager of the
leading hotel that, much as I had enjoyed myself under his humble
but hospitable roof, I would give him leave to charge me twenty
dollars a day if ever he caught me within his doors again.</p>
<p>When the train arrived, of course there was no room.&nbsp;
This is the working season, and the C.P.R., as everyone calls it
in Canada, is hurrying on men to the front as fast as they can be
got.</p>
<p>However, I was permitted to get inside the mail van, in
company with a contractor, his wife, and a baby, which behaved
itself as well as could be expected under the circumstances; a
lady who was going to visit her husband, one of the contractors
on the line; and an invalid from Pennsylvania, who did not seem
much to enjoy that rough mode of travelling.&nbsp; We reached
Holt City about <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>eleven, when it was quite dark, and the only bed I
could find was a shelf in the van, on which I was glad to lie
down&mdash;but not, alas! to sleep.&nbsp; Had I got out, I should
have been lost, or run over by an engine&mdash;that is positive,
as there is no road, only divers rails, as, for instance, the
Continental Hotel at Newhaven.&nbsp; I am now writing in the
post-office, which seems the great social centre of the place,
though the mail only leaves twice a week.&nbsp; It is a
decent-sized tent, with a desk and counter in the middle for the
sale of stamps and cigars and the delivery of letters.&nbsp;
Behind it are a couple of beds on which men are reposing in a way
that I envy, and covered with buffalo skins&mdash;the possession
of which I envy them still more.&nbsp; In front is a table,
fitted up with old papers and a couple of uncommonly
uncomfortable benches, whereon are sitting various loafers,
smoking and talking, and warming themselves as best they can at
the big stove&mdash;one of which you now <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>see in
every Canadian house, and which but feebly keeps out the raw cold
of the morning.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Holt City is admirably located, to use an American phrase
which I heartily detest.&nbsp; It is a clearance in the forest,
bordered by the Bow River, which dashes foaming along.&nbsp;
There is a shed, which does duty for a railway station; a
collection of tents, in which the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of the
company dwell, or which hold the large stores it collects here; a
large shed for meals, a railway car, in which Mr. John Ross, the
able administrator of the C.P.R. in these parts, resides with his
accomplished wife; and further off are other tents, which do duty
as hotels, billiard-rooms, and shops.&nbsp; Up here, I see little
to remind me of the Old Country, except bottles of
Stephens&rsquo; inks, of Aldersgate Street, London, which, says
the head accountant, are the only inks on which they can
rely.</p>
<p>We are in a valley&mdash;a valley high up among the
mountains&mdash;as fair as that in <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>which Rasselas studied to be a
virtuous prince, but of a character common in the length and
breadth of the Rockies.&nbsp; I have seen scores of valleys as
fair; and yet I own the exquisite loveliness of the spot&mdash;at
any rate, in summer time&mdash;is marvellous.&nbsp; Around me
rise Alps on Alps, up into the cloudless blue.&nbsp; Firs, all
larch and pine, in all the freshness of their new-found greenery,
clothe their base; while the snow, in wreaths like marble,
glistens on their dark sides or crowns their rugged peaks.&nbsp;
It would seem as if there could be no world beyond.&nbsp; It is
really wonderful what pleasant nooks of this kind one sees
everywhere.&nbsp; I stopped at one such last night, a station
called Canmore, which, however, seemed to be the fairest of them
all&mdash;and so the fish think, as the station-master tells me
he often catches speckled trout seven or eight pounds in
weight.&nbsp; Very near are valuable sulphur and other springs,
and when the railway shall be completed, I look forward <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>to the time
when Pullman cars shall come here laden with health seekers from
all parts of the world, who are fond of fishing and fine air.</p>
<p>I had a narrow escape from not coming here at all.&nbsp; When
we stopped at Canmore for our evening meal, I found I was utterly
unable to climb back into the mail van.&nbsp; I may be young in
heart, but, alas!&nbsp; I have lost somewhat of the agility of
early youth.&nbsp; I mentioned this to the station-master and
guard, who both promised me repeatedly that they would have the
train drawn up for me.&nbsp; Knowing this, I listened
unconcernedly to the cry of &lsquo;All on board!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Judge, then, of my horror when I saw the train gradually gliding
past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jump into the last car,&rsquo; cried the guard, as he
saw me looking daggers at him.</p>
<p>Fortunately I succeeded in doing so: it is easier to get on to
an American car when in motion than on an English one, on account
of <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>its
peculiar construction.&nbsp; This is fortunate, as the railway
passenger in Canada has to trust entirely to himself.&nbsp; He is
ignored by guards and porters and station-master
altogether.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I jumped on to the car sacred to
the person of Sir John McNeil, and I was requested by the black
cook to move off, which I declined doing till we reached the next
station, when I moved into another car, and created not a little
laughter as I told my story.&nbsp; It is to be trusted that Sir
John enjoyed himself all the more for having got rid of my vulgar
presence.&nbsp; I hope Sir John may enlighten his friends on his
return; but I fear he will gain little knowledge of the people or
the country, travelling in such a way.&nbsp; Perhaps he will
learn as much about it as the Marquis of Lorne, or the Earl of
Carnarvon, who recommends the poor people of the East-end to come
to Canada, where the chances are they will be worse off than they
are at home.&nbsp; Canada requires <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>hardy, muscular men&mdash;if with
money in their pockets so much the better&mdash;not the refuse of
our towns.</p>
<p>Again, I repeat, people in England ought to have fuller
information about Canada ere they go thither.&nbsp; It is a
fortune for the strong man, but even he has to run risks.&nbsp;
Everywhere I hear of what is called mountain fever, or Red River
fever, or fever with some other name which stands for typhoid
disease.&nbsp; Grand and beautiful as is the country, fertile as
is the soil, people forget to observe sanitary laws at times and
suffer in consequence.&nbsp; But I must own that all the men I
met in Holt City were pictures of health and strength.&nbsp; For
one thing, the company feeds them well.&nbsp; I have just
breakfasted in camp with the men.&nbsp; We had good coffee and
fried ham and other good things for breakfast, and good tins of
preserved fruits, to which everyone did justice.&nbsp; Everyone
here has to rough it.&nbsp; I washed this morning in the open
air, having myself ladled <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>into a tin basin the water out of a
cask in which still floated the broken ice.</p>
<p>Holt City is, I suppose, the head-quarters of the C.P.R.&nbsp;
Yet it is a place by itself.&nbsp; Nothing can be rougher than
the rail from here to Calgary, or finer than the view.&nbsp; It
is an advantage that the trains are so slow, as you have more
time to enjoy the scenery, which has almost shaken my attachment
to the Hebrides, though one misses the purple heather which lends
such a charm to the grey hills of the North.&nbsp; But
comparisons are odious, and the Rockies, in all their charms,
must be seen to be appreciated.&nbsp; It was a wonderful view I
had last night as I sat on the steps of the last car, drinking in
all the strange beauties of the place.&nbsp; We were climbing
hour by hour a wilderness of mountains.&nbsp; We were hemmed in
by them from afternoon till night came down upon the face of the
earth.&nbsp; Mostly they were black, with snowy variations; some
were bare, others <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>clothed with verdure.&nbsp; Some raised their heads in
the clear blue sky as fortresses, others were peaks, others
ragged and uneven, shapeless masses of matter growing out of one
another.&nbsp; Some seemed to like good company, others stood
solitary and apart.</p>
<p>In the dells and shadows there are tales yet to be told.&nbsp;
For instance, here are some remains of the ancient road to
British Columbia.&nbsp; Here, a man tells me, last year there was
a terrible tragedy.&nbsp; An English gentleman and his son were
camping near the spot.&nbsp; There came a forest fire.&nbsp;
Awful to relate, when the son had time to look around him, his
father was burnt to death.&nbsp; Fearful are some of the
solitudes through which the passenger plunges.&nbsp; The bear and
the eagle have them entirely to themselves.&nbsp; Few have
explored them; fewer still have scaled the mountain heights by
which they are girdled.&nbsp; But nowadays one is in search of
silver or gold or coal, and has no time to think of <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>mountain
grandeur.&nbsp; Cities rise and fall very quickly here.&nbsp;
Silver City, for instance, where we stopped last night, was all
the rage a year or two ago.&nbsp; It is now deserted.&nbsp; Yet
people say silver is still to be found there, and at Calgary, as
an illustration of the fact, a &lsquo;prospector&rsquo; showed me
a fine specimen of silver, at the same time asking me to come and
see the shaft.&nbsp; I replied I was as fond of silver as he was,
but I sought it in another way.</p>
<p>But to return to the Rockies.&nbsp; I wonder not that in times
past the Indians saw in them the home of the gods, or that there
the scientist discovers in them the source of the whirlwind or
the storm.</p>
<p>I am again train-bound.&nbsp; No one knows when we may have a
train from the east, and till we have one it is impossible for me
to get away.&nbsp; Physically, perhaps, this is a good thing for
me, as it enables me to recuperate.&nbsp; Here I am, 5,000 or
6,000 feet above the level of the <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>sea, breathing mountain air, and
luxuriating in mountain scenery.&nbsp; Last night I slept in a
caboose, and it was the best night&rsquo;s rest I have had for a
long time.&nbsp; I went to bed at nine and was up again at
five.&nbsp; Do my readers know what a caboose is?&nbsp; It is a
railway luggage-car on wheels.&nbsp; Mine is rather a superior
one, and has an upper and a lower chamber, and has in the upper
chamber a row of shelves, which do service as beds.&nbsp; I had
one of these to myself, and, as I was well provided with
blankets, did not much grieve at the absence of linen sheets.</p>
<p>My dear old friend, Mrs. Moodie, wrote a capital book, called
&lsquo;Roughing It in the Bush.&rsquo;&nbsp; Assuredly I may, one
of these days, write one on roughing it in the Rockies, though
the keeper of the caboose, out of respect for my age and
infirmities, does all he can to make me comfortable.&nbsp;
Already I feel the better for the air.&nbsp; For the first time
since I have been in Canada I have felt hungry; for the <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>first time,
also, since I have been in Canada I have not had to physic myself
with chlorodyne.&nbsp; A month up here in the Rockies would make
a young man of me or of anyone else.&nbsp; I must be off before I
become as gay as a horse fed on beans.&nbsp; This is, I take it,
the real and sufficient reason of the peculiar spirits of the
mountaineers, who rather alarmed me with their liveliness at
Calgary.&nbsp; Their exuberance is due to air, and air
alone.&nbsp; As I sit, a long row of mules files past; a man is
riding at the head, the others follow with their burdens packed
on their backs.&nbsp; He is a &lsquo;prospector,&rsquo; and is on
his way to the other side.&nbsp; Already as many as a thousand
such have gone the same road this summer.</p>
<p>The mountains are full of wealth&mdash;in the shape of gold or
silver, or coal or slate, or other precious commodities.&nbsp;
Hitherto the cost of conveyance has kept people away.&nbsp; The
opening of the C.P.R. will remove that inconvenience.&nbsp; They
will have a chance now <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>of getting rid of their minerals,
when discovered, and of fetching up their stores from the East at
less expense.&nbsp; As it is, things are dear enough in Holt
City.&nbsp; For instance, if I send or receive a letter, I have
to pay the postmaster a few cents in addition to the usual
postage-stamp.&nbsp; Calgary I thought bad enough, but up here
prices may be quoted as much higher.&nbsp; Yesterday I had a ride
over the mountains.&nbsp; It will be long before I take such a
ride again.&nbsp; No English coachman would drive such a road for
five hundred a year.&nbsp; No English carriage could stand it,
nor English horses either.&nbsp; I expected the buggy, as it was
called, to be shattered into atoms every minute&mdash;it looked
so light and frail, and the horses&mdash;a handsome pair, the
property of Mr. Ross&mdash;to be ruined for life; yet we got
safely to the front&mdash;where the men are hard at work cutting
down trees, removing earth, tunnelling, and pushing on the work
with all their might; and there, I must say, there are <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>openings
for any number of men who like to come out.&nbsp; Last year
little was done in the winter, because the contractors believed
the climate would be against them.&nbsp; No one before then had
wintered in the Rockies, and everyone believed the climate to be
much worse than it really is.</p>
<p>But to return to the ride.&nbsp; I yet feel it in every bone
in my body, as all the time I had to hold on to my seat like grim
death.&nbsp; Sometimes the coachman was high above me; sometimes
I was at the top and he at the bottom; now we were deep in the
mud, the next moment high and dry on a formidable boulder, bigger
than a hogshead, and came down with a bang, which sent me
quivering all over.&nbsp; Here we were with the water up to the
floor; and then we came on a mudbank quite as deep.&nbsp; Not an
inch of the ground was level.&nbsp; It was all collar work or the
reverse.&nbsp; Fortunately we were shaded by the firs which climb
all the mountains out <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>here, or the heat would have been
unbearable.&nbsp; As to conversation, that was quite out of the
question, though the &lsquo;boy&rsquo; who drove me came when a
child from Devonshire, and had a strong wish to see the old
country again, of whose lanes, yellow with primroses, and
cottages bright with roses and honeysuckles, and farmhouses green
with ivy, he had a very vivid recollection.&nbsp; He made a lot
of money, he said.&nbsp; Indeed, he had more than he knew what to
do with.&nbsp; Last winter, for instance, he stopped a month in
Winnipeg, and spent there four hundred dollars.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
did it all go?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! in treating the
boys!&rsquo; was his answer.&nbsp; I rather intimated that was a
poor way of using his money.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;they all do it.&nbsp; That is the way of the boys in this
country!&rsquo;&nbsp; I was glad to hear him say that he thought
of taking a farm soon, and was putting by the money for that
purpose.&nbsp; The Rocky Mountains cannot be a bad place for a
&lsquo;boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of them yesterday <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>told me how
he had vainly written to his father to come out, who was now in
the old country breaking stones on the road.&nbsp; Here, at any
rate, he would have been better off.&nbsp; It is a long journey,
I know, for the British emigrant.&nbsp; We are more than 1,000
miles from Winnipeg, and the ride is a dreary one till you reach
the Rockies.&nbsp; The run to Winnipeg from Toronto by Port
Arthur and Owen Sound is a real enjoyment.&nbsp; It took us two
days and two nights to reach Port Arthur from Toronto, and the
trip from Port Arthur to Winnipeg is accomplished easily in
twenty hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any bears about here?&rsquo; said I to the
&lsquo;boy,&rsquo; in one of the few minutes allowed for
conversation in the course of our rough ride yesterday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not many.&nbsp; I seed one near where we are
passing.&nbsp; He was a black bear, and stood up and looked at
me, and then I looked at him.&nbsp; I wished I&rsquo;d had a gun,
and then I would have shot him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Fortunately I saw no bear, black or brown, in the woods
as we drove amongst them; scarcely a bird&mdash;only one, an owl
I think, on the top of a tree, which never moved, though we were
close upon it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you make any difference in work on
Sunday?&rsquo; I asked of one of the men.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh no;
Sunday ain&rsquo;t of much account here.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is to
be regretted, if only for physical considerations.&nbsp; Everyone
can work all the better for a day of rest.&nbsp; Again, I think
the C.P.R. injures itself in this way, that it may lose the
services of useful men who like to keep the Sabbath, either from
physical or religious considerations.&nbsp; As a matter of fact,
I found many did take a rest on Sunday, and it was amusing to see
how the morning was devoted to haircutting and shaving and
mending clothes in the open air.&nbsp; A man, I know, can spend
his Sunday at honest work better than in drinking.&nbsp; But when
we think of the wild life of the miners and navvies in the <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>ends of the
earth&mdash;a life so wild that the C.P.R. has got a law passed
to forbid the sale of intoxicating drink, and people are appalled
when they read, in spite of the law, whisky is supplied to men
who have a large number of revolvers at their side&mdash;it seems
that a little provision might be made for the religious wants of
the community.&nbsp; The philosopher will laugh, I admit.&nbsp;
My reply is: Men were lifted out of degradation by the Christian
religion in some form or other, and as we root that out we may
expect society to retrograde.&nbsp; These men to the front will
pay for looking after.&nbsp; They are fine fellows mostly.&nbsp;
At any rate, they are the pioneers of modern civilization, and
should be reverenced as such.&nbsp; They are to be honoured for
their work&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; They plant, we gather the
fruit.&nbsp; They sow the seed, we reap the harvest, and their
work remains a monument of perseverance, of the benefits of the
Union, of enterprise, and capital and skill.&nbsp; That <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Canada has
thus carried the railway and the telegraph across the Rockies
shows that England and America will have to look to their
industrial laurels.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am alive, I am thankful to say; but it seems to me that I
should have left my bones on the Kicking Horse Lake, which lies
on the slope of the Rockies, situated in British Columbia, where
the scenery becomes grander and the air balmier as it comes up
laden with the soft breeze of the Pacific.&nbsp; You see that at
once in the superior size of the trees which clothe the sides of
that part of the Rockies.</p>
<p>As far as what the navvies call the front, I had the benefit
of the temporary railway by which Mr. Ross sends his
labourers.&nbsp; It is then the great difficulties of the work
commence, as the rocks are tremendous, and one of the tunnels
making will be three-quarters of a mile long.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>This
hot weather I can scarce imagine how the men and horses stand the
work; of the former, some were digging, others cutting down the
trees, others removing rocks, others filling up the swamps.&nbsp;
Here the waggons were being laden with stores to be sent further
to the front; now and then a long trail of mules sweeps by with
miners and miners&rsquo; stores, and I plunge into the forest,
shaded from the fierce sun by the tall firs, and as I struggle in
the swamps caused by the melting snows, I can realize something
of the hardships of the early travellers&mdash;hardships of which
the tourist, when the rail is completed, will have no idea,
though he will be a little alarmed as the mountains drop away
beneath his feet for more than a hundred miles to the Columbia
river, while the narrow track of rails winds along its
sides.&nbsp; In the winter this pass, when covered with snow, is
very dangerous, and many are the mules and horses dashed to
pieces over the precipice.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>The
lake, when I reach it, is full of ice and snow, and all round the
mountains rear their snow-capped heads.&nbsp; One of the
peculiarities of this region is the abundance of water in some
shape or other, and the shadows on the lakes reflect as a mirror
all the surrounding scene&mdash;the dark forest at the base, the
masses of slate-like rock above, the snow in all its radiant
white higher up, the unclouded azure that crowns and glorifies
all.</p>
<p>Heated and tired, I throw myself on the moss, and realize, in
all its intensity, the appalling loneliness of forest
life&mdash;I startle three wild ducks, that is all.&nbsp; Down on
my left comes the rushing torrent in a series of picturesque
waterfalls into the lake.&nbsp; I climb the mountain by the side
of them.&nbsp; The water sends to me an ice-laden air, which
revives me as I struggle upwards and onwards, watching the
whirlpools and cascades as the water angrily struggles to force
its way through the iron barriers by which it is <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>hemmed
in.&nbsp; I secure a fine specimen of petrified moss from a
stream close by.&nbsp; But I may not linger.&nbsp; Already I feel
weak as I plunge into the frozen snow, or sink where the sun has
melted it into morass, or stumble over an old moss-grown trunk,
or climb the big trunks which the axeman has already levelled, or
pass the streams which intersect the plain on logs off which I
expect to slip every moment.&nbsp; Then I come to the railway
men, and avail myself of the imperfect and unconnected track
which they have formed; but now the sun beats fiercely on me, and
I can scarcely put one foot before another.&nbsp; The spirit is
willing, but the flesh is weak.&nbsp; Fortunately, I reach the
tent of a good Samaritan.&nbsp; I refresh myself with water from
the crystal stream.&nbsp; I lunch on bread and cheese, with tea
kindly fetched from the company&rsquo;s hut, but I have to lie
down three hours before I feel myself equal to urging on my wild
career again.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>British Columbia seems at present to be chiefly
occupied by miners.&nbsp; No other kind of emigrants are needed
there.&nbsp; The country is mountainous&mdash;a regular sea of
mountains; but, writes an occasional correspondent of <i>The
Toronto Mail</i>, &lsquo;there are beautiful valleys, far
surpassing anything you have in Ontario, and the mountains and
hills furnish pasture.&nbsp; Considering the climate, the rich
soil, and the high price paid for all farming produce, I believe
there cannot be a more desirable place for the farmer.&nbsp; I
have no hesitation in saying that a farm of fifty acres is worth
more than a hundred in the East.&nbsp; All you have to do is to
sow your land with good seed and you are sure of a bountiful
return.&nbsp; No weevil, midge, wire-worm, potato bug, nor, in
fact, any farmers&rsquo; pests, exist here.&nbsp; There are no
scorching hot days and sultry nights; no heavy frost or deep snow
to impede work; consequently you are not driven like a slave for
six months and frozen <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>in for the other six, but have
steady work all the year round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other writers bear a similar testimony.&nbsp; With all its
advantages, however, the country has one drawback&mdash;the
scarcity and high price of labour.&nbsp; It seems well looked
after by the Episcopalians, who have a Bishop here and several
clergymen, and, as I may suppose the other denominations are
equally in earnest and equally active, it is clear settlers may
enjoy the advantages of the forms of religious life with which
they are familiar, and under which they have been reared.</p>
<p>British Columbia, which entered the Canadian Confederation in
1871, is the most westerly of the Canadian Provinces.&nbsp; It
has a coast-line on the Pacific Ocean of about 600 miles, that
is, in a straight line.&nbsp; If its almost innumerable
indentations and bays were measured, the coast-line would extend
to several thousands of miles.</p>
<p>The area of the Province, according to the <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>Census
measurement, is 341,305 square miles.&nbsp; Its position on the
American continent is one of great commercial importance, and its
resources are in keeping with its position.&nbsp; If it were to
be described from the characteristics of its climate, its mineral
wealth, and its natural commercial relations, it might be said to
be the Great Britain and California combined of the Dominion of
Canada.</p>
<p>The Province is divided into two parts: the Islands, of which
Vancouver is the principal, and the Mainland.&nbsp; Vancouver is
about 300 miles long, with an average breadth of about sixty
miles, containing an area of about 20,000 square miles.</p>
<p>British Columbia has numerous harbours and rivers, some of
which are of importance, and all are remarkable for their
bountiful, in fact wonderful, supplies of fish.&nbsp; The scenery
which it possesses is magnificently beautiful.</p>
<p>The climate on the coast is more equable and much milder in
winter than in any other <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>part of Canada; but as the mountains
are ascended, greater cold prevails, with more snow, and the
characteristics of greater dryness of atmosphere which mark the
climate of the interior of the continent are found.</p>
<p>The population of British Columbia, by the Census of 1881, did
not exceed 49,459, of which 25,661 were Indians.&nbsp; This
comparatively sparse population is due to the hitherto isolated
position of the Province; but now that railway communication
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Dominion of
Canada is being rapidly pushed forward to completion by a route
which offers the easiest gradients and the most important natural
commercial advantages of any possible line across the continent
of America, the inducements the Province offers to settlers are
beginning to attract the attention, as well of the emigrating
classes of the Old World, as of the migrating classes of this
continent; and population is already beginning to flow <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>rapidly
in.&nbsp; It is beyond doubt that the percentage of increase
which will be shown at the next decennial Census will be a
statistical fact to excite men&rsquo;s wonder.&nbsp; Its
fisheries, its forests, its mineral resources, will provide work
for thousands who are starving at home.&nbsp; And it will be
easily reached when the Canadian Pacific Railway is
completed.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have now reached the end of my journey, and I sum up my
emigration experiences.&nbsp; The emigrant, if strong and
industrious, and ready to take advantage of opportunities, and
not averse to roughing it, will be sure to find work; but he must
be shy, if he has cash, of land schemers, and I would advise him,
if he thinks of settling, not to be in a hurry about it, but to
take time to look around.&nbsp; I have seen as fine farming
country as anywhere in the world.&nbsp; I have seen other parts
where no one can get a living.&nbsp; Amongst the emigrants I see
many who must succeed anywhere, <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and many who will go to the wall
wherever they may be.</p>
<p>Let me give you another illustration of the bursting of an
emigration scheme.&nbsp; The London dailies often have
advertisements offering for a certain bonus to provide young men
with homes where farming in all its branches is taught.&nbsp; The
London (Ont.) papers tell how a number of young fellows have been
taken in in this way.&nbsp; They paid the advertisers sums from
thirty pounds upwards, in addition to their passage money, the
consideration being that on their arrival in Ontario they were to
be placed on farms and kept there at the agent&rsquo;s
expense.&nbsp; Of course, when they reached their journey&rsquo;s
end, no farmers were to be found.&nbsp; If a young Englishman
wishes to try farming in Canada, he cannot do better than hire
himself to a farmer for a year or two and keep his money in his
pocket for the purchase of a farm.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>But
even then he must not buy a farm till he knows something about
it, and he cannot be long out here before he will find out where
the good land is.&nbsp; A Canadian whom I met at Calgary, told me
that he knew a farm near Toronto which was regularly in the
market every year.&nbsp; It is safe to be bought by an
Englishman, who tries it for a time, gives it up in despair, and
then it comes into the market again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there any stones on the farm?&rsquo; asked an
Englishman, after he had purchased his farm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only saw one,&rsquo; was the encouraging reply: and
it was a truthful one.&nbsp; There was but one stone, but then it
embraced the surface of the whole farm.</p>
<p>The English purchaser must have his wits about him.&nbsp; Here
he is by many regarded as a stranger, and they take him in.&nbsp;
The poet tells us where ignorance is bliss &rsquo;tis folly to be
wise.&nbsp; Ignorance is not bliss in <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>Canada, emigrants really must have
their wits about them or they will suffer much.</p>
<p>Near Moosomin there is some fine country where many English
have settled.&nbsp; Only last week an Englishman selected a farm
in that locality for a homestead.&nbsp; He at once proceeded
there, having at considerable expense hired a conveyance for his
wife and four children.&nbsp; When he got there he found the land
already occupied.&nbsp; To add to his troubles, when he returned
to Moosomin one of his children died; the result is that the wife
has grown home-sick, the poor man disheartened; he wants to
return to England, but he has already exhausted his means.&nbsp;
This want of harmony between the land office and the guides,
according to <i>The Manitoba Free Press</i>, is said to be of
frequent occurrence.&nbsp; The Dominion Government ought to see
to this.&nbsp; They are eager to promote emigration, but many
such cases will make English farmers naturally a little reluctant
to come out.</p>

225</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">DANGERS OF THE ROCKIES.&mdash;PRAIRIE
FIRES.&mdash;THE RETURN.&mdash;PORT ARTHUR.&mdash;MIGRANTS.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of snow in the Rockies.&nbsp; In June
that snow begins to melt.&nbsp; The result is, a violent body of
water rushes down, which makes the railway people very
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>On Sunday I met the engine-driver of the train by which I was
to travel east next morning.&nbsp; At Holt City it seems no one
knows from what particular spot the train will start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t start without me?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I will look to see whether you are on
board.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you must leave at
five, whether I am on board or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! as to that,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;no one can make
me start before I am ready.&nbsp; But,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;perhaps we may not get away at all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like the look of the bridge, and there is a deal of water
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I smiled incredulously.&nbsp; Had not I seen, only an hour
before, with my own eyes, a special train arrive from the west
filled with labourers and freight?&nbsp; If that could cross in
safety, surely our lighter train could do the same.</p>
<p>Thus reasoning, I lay down with a light heart in my caboose,
having invoked, not the saints, but every decent Christian I
could find, to take care that I might be aroused at four p.m., in
order that I might have a good wash before I started on my little
run of 1,500 miles, as far as Port Arthur.</p>
<p>Just as I was falling into the arms of Morpheus, to speak
poetically&mdash;a habit to <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>which I was much given in my earlier
days&mdash;a fellow-traveller came rushing into the caboose,
saying timidly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better get on board at once.&nbsp; The
bridge has given way, and they may go across at once,&rsquo; and
so saying, he left me in the dark.</p>
<p>However, I managed to jump out of my bed, collect my luggage,
and scramble down the plank, the only and somewhat perilous means
of access to my caboose, and stumble along the confusing lines of
railway by which Holt City is adorned, and climb up into a car,
wondering much all the while why we should start at all, when the
bridge had partly given way, or whether I had come all that
distance merely to find a watery grave.&nbsp; In the car I found
a company as grotesque and rough as any I had yet seen anywhere,
discussing the situation with more or less earnestness.</p>
<p>The bridge, I heard, was being repaired; <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>that was a
comfort.&nbsp; But still no one knew when we should start.&nbsp;
Now and then we moved a few feet forward, or a few feet backward;
but, in reality, I believe we remained in the same position all
night, and started at the usual hour next morning.&nbsp; But the
horror of that night was something inexpressible.&nbsp; Sleep was
quite out of the question.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t sleep in an
American railway-car unless you are a navvy or a
contractor&mdash;who can sleep anywhere.&nbsp; In England, even
in a third-class carriage, the chances are you can lie down at
your full length and sleep.&nbsp; In Canada you can&rsquo;t do
that, as the seats are too short.&nbsp; So there I sat, bolt
upright, all through that tedious night, watching for the light
of day, while my companions sat smoking and talking and
expectorating.&nbsp; In a playful moment one of them suggested
that they should all take off their boots.&nbsp; Fortunately the
proposition did not meet with universal approval, and I was saved
that horror.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>In
the Rockies life is not all beer and &rsquo;baccy.&nbsp; One day
there was an alarm of fire.&nbsp; It seems the woods are on fire
all day long, and week after week.&nbsp; In this way much
valuable timber is destroyed, and no one knows who does the
mischief, or how it will terminate.&nbsp; Daily we saw the smoke
of a forest fire; one day the flames came so close to Holt City
that everyone was alarmed.&nbsp; If a spark or two reached the
place where the explosives were stored, Holt City and all its
inhabitants might have been blown to atoms.&nbsp; Down in the
prairies fire does a vast amount of mischief to the settler, who
awakes in the night to find his tent or house reduced to ashes,
and all his worldly goods destroyed.&nbsp; Such cases are of
frequent occurrence, especially at this season of the year, when
the settler sets fire to the prairie before ploughing, or to
insure a better crop of grass.&nbsp; One dark night, in
particular, I remember the prairie fire lent quite a mournful
grandeur to <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>the scene.&nbsp; Then there came a day I shall never
forget as long as I live.&nbsp; A Canadian summer may have its
peculiar charms, but I candidly own, not being a salamander, it
is far too hot for me.&nbsp; On that particular day the heat was
intense.&nbsp; It affected everyone.&nbsp; Those who dared drank
gallons of iced water, others pulled off their coats and collars
and lay down on the cushions with which the sleeping-car is
plentifully provided, and went off to sleep.&nbsp; It was in vain
one tried to pass away the time in smoking&mdash;it was too hot
for that.&nbsp; Newspapers and cheap novels were all
neglected&mdash;conversation was out of the question.&nbsp;
Everyone seemed on the point of giving up the ghost.&nbsp; Even
the blackie, who invariably acts as conductor to the
sleeping-car&mdash;and who is about the only civil official (with
the exception of the steamboat attendants, who are models of good
behaviour) one meets in Canadian travel, seemed, thinly clad as
he was, quite overcome.&nbsp; <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>The sun took all the colour out of
his cheeks, and he became quite pale&mdash;almost white.</p>
<p>In the course of our return journey we stopped at Moose Jaw
for supper, and then I witnessed a new development of prairie
life in the shape of a thunder-storm, which seemed to me
unusually vivid and protracted.&nbsp; The lightning was grand as
it swept over the wide sea of grass, making everything as bright
as noon-day, and then all was dark again.&nbsp; It brought us a
rain that had really healing in its wings.&nbsp; While the heat
lasted I was a martyr to prickly heat.&nbsp; It seemed to me that
I was going to have small-pox or measles.&nbsp; I had little
pimples all over me, and as to my wrists, they were really
painful, and I could not keep from scratching with a vivacity
which a Scotchman might have envied.&nbsp; Was it that vulgar
disease to which, it is said, the gallant Scot is peculiarly
liable?&nbsp; I could not say.&nbsp; I had shaken hands with <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>so many
filthy Indians, and it might be that, as I learn they are much
afflicted in that way.&nbsp; Happily the thunder-storm cooled the
air, and I felt all the better for it.&nbsp; When I got as far as
Port Arthur, and inhaled the cool air of Lake Superior, I
suffered no more from unpleasant irritation of the skin.&nbsp; It
was with joy I embarked on the C.P.R.&rsquo;s fine steamer, the
<i>Alberta</i>, for Owen Sound.&nbsp; But even travelling on Lake
Superior has its disadvantages.&nbsp; The water of the Lake is
intensely cold, and when the sun beats fiercely on it there is
sure to be a fog.&nbsp; Such happened to be the case on my
return, and we ploughed slowly along for a while, seeing hardly
anything of the beauty of the scene, while every few minutes we
were cheered by the dismal notes of the fog-horn.&nbsp;
Fortunately the fog lifted, and then what a display we had of
islands, green as emerald, on the tranquil sea!&nbsp; I must add,
also, I had good company everywhere, with the exception of <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>the great
Sir John M&rsquo;Neill, who had his meals apart from us at a
table all to himself, and an English clergyman from
Staffordshire, whom a Canadian gentleman described to me as
&lsquo;a regular crank,&rsquo; whatever that may mean.&nbsp; The
parson is going to write a book, so he tells the people; but he
shuns me, which is a pity, as I met a friend at Calgary who told
me they had great fun with the parson on their way up from
Winnipeg, telling him all sorts of cock-and-bull stories, which
he greedily entered in his note-book.</p>
<p>I must give you one more sketch of a Canadian town as an
illustration of the enterprise and pluck which are the main
characteristics of the Canadian of to-day.&nbsp; If you look at
the map, you will see Port Arthur is situated in Thunder Bay, and
Thunder Bay, when you pass the rocky barrier by which it is
encircled, opens out into Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Thunder Bay is a sheet of water some 13 by 19 miles in area,
sheltered from the wild <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>storms which sweep over the northern
lakes by the Pie and Welcome Islands and the Thunder Cape on one
side, and by the terraced bluffs of ever-green forest on the
other; forming thus an unsurpassed harbour for extent and
accommodation, and having claim to be what its admirers say it
is, the prettiest of all the American Lakes.</p>
<p>It is not an agricultural district that surrounds Port Arthur,
though it is a fact that there are vast stretches of rich lands
within its borders, including the Kamanistique and other valleys,
on which at least 3,000 families could settle and get a good
living by agriculture.</p>
<p>The timber resources of the surrounding country, which must
find its centre and point of collection in the quiet waters of
the bay, comprise thousands of square miles of spruce and other
trees; while iron, copper, zinc, and silver are to be found in
the neighbouring <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>rocks.&nbsp; Gold also is said to be hidden in the
bowels of the earth; though not yet discovered in paying
quantities.&nbsp; However this may be, one thing is clear, that
from Thunder Bay the whole agricultural exports of the countless
fertile acres of the Canadian North-West must find an
outlet.&nbsp; Truly did the Marquis of Lorne, when here, describe
it as &lsquo;The Silver Gate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Port Arthur&mdash;as it was termed when Sir Garnet Wolseley
arrived here on his way to suppress the Riel revolt in the
North-West, out of compliment to the Duke of Connaught&mdash;is
in reality one of the few places in Canada that have a
history.&nbsp; As early as the beginning of the sixteenth
century, some of the French settlers had formed an idea that the
great Lake Superior was a highway to the vast fur-producing
countries of the North-West, although not till 1641 did any white
man venture upon its waters.&nbsp; In 1678 a Frenchman built
himself a house in the vicinity of <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Port Arthur, and commenced trading
with the surrounding Indians for their furs.</p>
<p>In 1857 the attention of the Canadian Government was called to
the spot, and they sent out commissioners to explore, who, in
1859, published a report which created quite a sensation all over
Canada.&nbsp; In due time the C.P.R., which is the great
mainspring of all the North-West, took up Port Arthur, had all
their stores and men carted there, and now Port Arthur has a
grand future before it, of which it is impossible to predict the
whole extent.&nbsp; I have great faith in Port Arthur.&nbsp; It
must in time be another Montreal or Toronto.&nbsp; Moose Jaw is
going down.&nbsp; It will be long before Calgary will be much of
a place.&nbsp; The Silver City is half deserted; and at Winnipeg
the boom has burst and bankruptcy prevails; but Port Arthur is
bound to go ahead.</p>
<p>I spent there a night on my return, and saw a marvellous
change&mdash;even since my visit <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>there a fortnight previously.&nbsp;
Then people were hard at work putting up wooden shops; now those
shops are fitted up with glass fronts, and already filled with
merchandise from all quarters of the earth, though in many cases
the upper parts of the building are in an incomplete state.&nbsp;
Every day ships arrive from the American side; thus, within a
couple of days previous to my arrival, 20,000 tons of coal had
been landed.&nbsp; There are steamers of all sorts and sizes in
the harbour, constantly coming in or going out.&nbsp; On one side
a new elevator has been erected, on the other side is a great
store of lumber and a saw-mill.</p>
<p>Yesterday Port Arthur was a township, now it is incorporated
as a city, and rejoices in a mayor.&nbsp; The place is full of
hotels, which charge high prices, give very little for the money,
and do a roaring trade.&nbsp; A very handsome English church is
being erected; just by, the Presbyterians are building one
equally handsome, only a little smaller.&nbsp; The <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>Roman
Catholics make quite a grand show with their brick church and
convent and schools, while the Methodists have a very plain and
ugly imitation of an English church, with its steeple all in wood
and painted white, which attests, at any rate, if not their
taste, their influence and wealth.&nbsp; I visited the
school-room, which was filled with bright and well-fed boys and
girls, where the children are taught free, as they are all over
Canada&mdash;where they have, by-the-bye, a compulsory law, which
is never enforced, as it is impossible to do so.&nbsp; And then I
made my way to the best-looking building in the town&mdash;the
emigrants&rsquo; shed&mdash;where already 3,600 emigrants have
this season been lodged gratis by the Dominion Government
previous to their passing onwards to the North-West.</p>
<p>People tell me there is no room for mechanics in Canada.&nbsp;
In Port Arthur I see them in constant demand.&nbsp; At one shop
window I see a notice to the effect that 10 carpenters are <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>required,
at another a demand for painters, while a third shop window seeks
to secure good tinsmiths.&nbsp; At the chief draper&rsquo;s shop
there is a notice stating four good assistants are
required.&nbsp; What a pity the discontented men whom I left at
Montreal, because work was not offered them immediately they
landed, did not come thus far!&nbsp; As to rockmen and labourers,
they are wanted by the hundred.&nbsp; Surely, Port Arthur must be
a good place for the working man and the working girl.&nbsp; Even
at Calgary they were paying the female helps at the
hotel&mdash;as sour a set as I ever saw&mdash;and who were
constantly quarrelling with John Smith, the Chinaman
cook&mdash;as much as 40 dollars a month.&nbsp; But even out here
a man must have brains.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came out here seven years ago,&rsquo; said a
gentleman to me as we sat on one of the rocks which line Port
Arthur, &lsquo;and could find nothing to do.&nbsp; I was brought
up in a foundry, and had saved 1,100 dollars.&nbsp; I went all
round; <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>no one could give me a job.&nbsp; Then I began buying a
few hides; this brought me into contact with a great fur merchant
at Chicago&mdash;he employed me as his agent at 80 dollars a
month.&nbsp; Then I gave that up and turned miller, and the year
before last I traded to the extent of a quarter of a million
dollars.&nbsp; Last year I was too eager, and lost a lot of
money; but this year I hope to get it all back again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why cannot an English emigrant be equally successful?&nbsp; Is
it because we do not send out the right sort of men?</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is not one man in a hundred that comes out here
from London who is of any use,&rsquo; said an old Toronto
trader&mdash;himself an Englishman&mdash;to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
never call myself an Englishman,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When I go to London I always say I am a Canadian.&nbsp; I
am ashamed of the name of Englishman.&nbsp; What would Sir Garnet
Wolseley have done when he was here had it not have been for the
Canadian Volunteers?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>I am
glad to hear, however, that he had nothing but praise for the
Scotch settlers Lady Cathcart was sending out.&nbsp; She advances
them money, and they pay her back a good rate of interest.&nbsp;
Why cannot other people do the same?&nbsp; Another question,
also, may be asked: Why cannot certain Canadian land companies,
who really offer purchasers a fair bargain, put up a few houses
on their separate farms?&nbsp; The settler has to build his house
under every disadvantage.&nbsp; I am sure they could build the
houses by contract at half the expense; and they could have a
mortgage on the farm, which would ensure them in every case
against loss, and which might add materially to their profits as
well.</p>
<p>If the crops this year turn out well in the North-West, and,
according to present prospects, there is every reason to suppose
they will, the farmers will pour into the country in a way which
they have never done before, and the prosperity of the North-West
will be <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>placed on a solid basis.&nbsp; Be that as it may, there
are bright days in store for Port Arthur.</p>
<p>On the green forest, rising up above the town and overlooking
Thunder Bay, it is intended to build a first-class summer hotel
for the comfort of holiday makers and health seekers.&nbsp; There
the visitor will enjoy fine cool air in the sultry heat of
summer, while bathing in the lake will invigorate his enfeebled
frame.&nbsp; The waters abound with fish.&nbsp; Islands and lakes
and rivers tempt the yachtsman.&nbsp; If the workmen who squander
their hard-earned wages in reckless drunkenness would but learn
to be sober, few places on the Canadian lakes would be more
enjoyable than Port Arthur.</p>

<p>I cannot leave Canada without speaking of its Grand Trunk
Railway, which meets the emigrant at Port Levi when he lands at
Quebec, and which he will undoubtedly often patronise if he
tarries long in the land.&nbsp; It has built the Victoria Bridge
at Montreal, one <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>of the wonders of Canada&mdash;a tubular structure of
magnificent proportions, which spans the St. Lawrence, and gives
uninterrupted communication to the western traffic with that of
the United States.&nbsp; Including the abutments, the bridge is
9,084 feet in length.&nbsp; The tubes rest on twenty-four piers,
the main tubes being sixty feet above the level of the
river.&nbsp; It may well be called the Grand Trunk Railway, as it
operates under one management over six thousand miles of
first-class railway road.&nbsp; Having close connection at Port
Huron, Detroit and Chicago with the principal Western American
lines, it offers great advantages to emigrants to all parts of
the compass.&nbsp; At Montreal I had the pleasure of a long chat
with Mr. Joseph Hickson, the general manager, who takes a deep
interest in the subject of emigration, and Mr. W. Wainwright, the
assistant-manager, to whom I am indebted and grateful for many
acts of kindness, especially welcome to the <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>stranger in
a strange land.&nbsp; It is the Grand Trunk that takes the
traveller over Niagara Falls&mdash;on the International
Suspension Bridge connecting the Canadian Railways with those of
the States.&nbsp; This structure, which is 250 feet above the
water, commands a fine view up to the Falls.&nbsp; It is to be
feared that as long as Canada and the United States have separate
tariffs there will be not a little smuggling along this
bridge.&nbsp; When I was there I heard of a Canadian judge, who
with his family had been stopping at one or other of the hotels
on the Canadian side.&nbsp; One fine morning some of the ladies
of the party walked off to the American side, and returned laden
with bargains which had paid no duty.&nbsp; In their innocence
they boasted of the little transaction to the judge.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How can I,&rsquo; said he indignantly, &lsquo;punish
people for smuggling, if I find my own family do it?&rsquo; and
the ladies had to pay the duty, so the story goes, after all.</p>

245</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">BACK TO ENGLAND.&mdash;CANADIAN
HOSPITALITY.&mdash;THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH.&mdash;HOME.</p>
<p>My time was up, and I had to be off, after we got a look at
pleasant London in the wood, as my Canadian friends who have been
to England call it.&nbsp; I came back from Chicago to New York,
and had again to encounter the horrors of nights in a Pullman
sleeping-car.&nbsp; Why cannot the railway authorities separate
the part of the car devoted to the gentlemen from that part
inhabited by the ladies?&nbsp; The way in which the sexes are
mixed up at night is, to say the least, unpleasant.&nbsp; I shall
never forget my last experience in a Pullman sleeping-car.&nbsp;
An <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>ancient dame with blue spectacles, my
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, as the shades of evening came on, gave
me the horrors.&nbsp; In my despair I began undressing, thinking
that the outraged female would rush away in disgust.&nbsp; Alas!
she had stronger nerves than I calculated, and there she sat
gazing serenely with her tinted orbs till I plunged myself behind
my curtained berth, to encounter, early in the morning, once more
those eyes.</p>
<p>New York and Boston are full of fairy forms.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t they travel?&nbsp; The change would be pleasant for
sore eyes like mine.</p>
<p>No wonder I sat all that night thinking of the great kindness
I had received in Canada, and regretting especially that I had
refused an invitation to dine that evening at the home of one of
the leading barristers of Toronto, to meet some clergymen there
who were familiar with my name, and who wished to meet me.</p>
<p>Surely I did wrong to leave Toronto, with <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>all its
friendly faces and kindly hearts.&nbsp; It will be long ere I
cease to remember how the Canadians made me at home, as I met
them on the rail, or on the boat, or in the hotel.</p>
<p>Said a London Evangelist to me: &lsquo;You will find the
Canadians a cold people, who will show you no hospitality.&nbsp;
While I was there not one of them invited me to have a cup of
tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All I can say is, I found the Canadians quite the
reverse.&nbsp; But then my friend went on a mission, and is a man
of very serious views, while I travelled merely to see a land of
whose wonders I had heard much, to talk to sinners as well as
saints, and to learn from them what I could.</p>
<p>I was a great reformer once myself, and had glorious visions
which never came to pass.&nbsp; In youth we have all such
dreams.&nbsp; Now, as the days darken round me and the years, I
seek to put up with the shortcomings of my brother-man, trusting
that he in his <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Christian charity may extend a similar forbearance to
my own.</p>
<p>I came back in the <i>Assyrian Monarch</i>.&nbsp; I was glad I
did so.&nbsp; That fine ship has a distinguished record.&nbsp; It
has carried no end of theatricals to New York; it did the same
kind office for Jumbo: it carried troops and horses to Egypt; and
when we English undertook to punish Arabi, it was a home for the
refugees for a while.</p>
<p>Perhaps we have no ship more noticeable than the <i>Assyrian
Monarch</i>, belonging to the Monarch Line, which runs weekly, I
fancy, between New York and London.</p>
<p>It is a great treat in the fine weather to take that
route.&nbsp; You are a little longer at sea&mdash;you glide along
the south coast till you reach the Scilly Isles, and the ships of
the company are all that can be desired.</p>
<p>It is a great deal of trouble and expense to some to go with
all their goods and chattels to Liverpool, then unpack them, and
get them <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>down to the landing-stage, and then repack them in one
or other of the far-famed steamers of that busy spot, and all
this you save if you patronize the ships of the Monarch Line,
which carry chiefly cargo, with a few saloon passengers as
well.</p>
<p>We had a very heavy cargo on board the <i>Assyrian Monarch</i>
as we came back from New York.&nbsp; We carried 260 bullocks,
besides cheese and grain, to make glad the heart and fill the
stomach, and thus one felt that if the screw were to fail or the
fog to hinder a rapid transit, there was corn in Egypt, and that
there was something to fall back on.&nbsp; Happily, we were not
driven to that alternative.&nbsp; We fared well in the saloon of
the <i>Assyrian Monarch</i>; so well, indeed, that a poor elderly
lady, who seemed at death&rsquo;s door when we started, became
quite vigorous, comparatively speaking, by the time we ended our
voyage.</p>
<p>We had more freedom in the way of sitting <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>up late and
having lights than is possible in a crowded passenger ship, and
we came more into contact with the captain of the ship and his
merry men.</p>
<p>In the case of the <i>Assyrian Monarch</i> this was a great
advantage, as Captain Harrison is a good companion as well as an
able navigator, and I felt myself safe in his hands, that is, as
far as anyone can be safe at sea.</p>
<p>Further, I felt that the chances were in my favour.&nbsp; The
<i>Assyrian Monarch</i> had carried over the Atlantic, in stormy
weather, the highly-respected and ever-to-be-regretted by
Londoners Jumbo; surely it could be trusted to perform the same
kind office for myself in the summer season, when the air is
still and the seas are calm; and so it did, though every now and
then we encountered that greatest of all dangers at sea, fog,
more or less dense, especially on the Banks of Newfoundland,
where the ice-laden waters of the Arctic come in contact with the
warmer waves of the Gulf <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Stream.&nbsp; As our course was very
fortunately much to the south, we had a good deal of the
latter.</p>
<p>That Gulf Stream was a revelation to me.&nbsp; When I took my
morning bath it seemed as if I were in warm water, and the new
forms of life it fostered and developed were particularly
pleasant to a casual observer like myself.&nbsp; There one could
see the nautilus, or the Portugeuse man-of-war, as it is
familiarly termed, in the language of the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Put out a tier of oars on either side,<br
/>
Spread to the wafting breeze a twofold sail,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and cruel, big-headed sharks, which, indeed, followed us
almost all the way to England (the fact is that now, when so many
cattle are thrown overboard, the Atlantic abounds with sharks),
and lovely flying-fish like streaks of silver flashing along the
deep and boundless blue ocean.&nbsp; Of these latter one flew on
board.&nbsp; It met with a cruel fate.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>eaten by
the first officer of the <i>Assyrian Monarch</i> for
breakfast.&nbsp; It ought to have choked him.&nbsp; It did
nothing of the kind; he, hardened sinner that he was, enjoyed it
greatly, and said that it was as good as a whiting.</p>
<p>In the Gulf Stream we found the usual number of whales and
porpoises.&nbsp; The latter would play around the bow or race
along the side of the ship in considerable quantities of all
sorts of sizes.&nbsp; There were other fish of which I know not
the names to be seen occasionally leaping out of the water as
high and repeatedly as possible, as if a shark were in their
midst seeking whom he might devour.</p>
<p>One sight I shall never forget in the Gulf Stream.&nbsp; It
was that of a tortoise.&nbsp; I was leaning over the ship&rsquo;s
side, when something big and round seemed to be coming to the
surface.&nbsp; I could not make out what it was; then all at once
the truth flashed upon me as <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>he wobbled along, paddling with his
fins, his head erect, his little eyes peering at the ship as if
he wondered what the dickens it was, and what business it had
there.&nbsp; He seemed to be treading the water.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I saw him but a moment,<br />
But methinks I see him now.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sight gave me quite an appetite, though my friend Sir
Henry Thompson will insist upon it that turtle soup is made of
conger-eel, but in the wide Atlantic one has time to think of
such things; day by day passes and you see nothing but the
ocean&mdash;not even a distant sail, or the smoke of a passing
steamer.</p>
<p>People complain of the uneventfulness of life on board a
ship.&nbsp; That, however, is a matter of great
thankfulness.&nbsp; A collision or a shipwreck are exciting, but
they are disagreeable, nevertheless.&nbsp; It seems the homeward
voyage is always the pleasantest as far <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>as the sea
is concerned, the wind being more frequently in the west than in
any other quarter.&nbsp; Perhaps that is one reason why the
Americans are so ready to cross the Atlantic.&nbsp; When I left
New York, Cook&rsquo;s office, in the Broadway, was full of
tourists, including Mrs. Langtry and other distinguished
personages.&nbsp; Mr. John Cook seems as popular in New York as
he is elsewhere.&nbsp; Indeed, I was confidentially informed that
he was engaged in organizing a personally-conducted tour for the
relief of Gordon and the capture of the Mahdi, and I hear from
Egypt that he has a chance of being made Khedive, a position
which I am certain he would fill with credit to himself and
advantage to the people.&nbsp; Of course, there is a little
exaggeration in this, but the American tourist has good reason to
revere the name of Cook, and so have we all.&nbsp; As much as
anyone he has promoted travel between the Old World and the New,
and has made us better friends.&nbsp; It is to <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>be hoped
that every steamer that crosses the Atlantic does something
similar.</p>
<p>I must own, however, that the nearer I approached England the
more I felt ashamed of my native land.&nbsp; The weather was
villainous.&nbsp; It rained every day, and the worst of it was, I
had had the audacity to assure the Americans on board that we had
dry weather in England, that occasionally we saw the sun, and
that we were not a web-footed race.&nbsp; Fortunately, at the
time of writing this I have not yet encountered any of my
American friends, or I should feel, as they say, uncommonly
mean.&nbsp; However, the weather was fine enough to admit of a
good look at Bishop&rsquo;s Rock, the name of the lighthouse at
the Scilly Isles, where we got our first sight of land; you can
imagine how we all rushed on deck to see that.&nbsp; In fine
weather, I say, by all means return from America in one of the
fine, steady, well-built ships of the Monarch Line.&nbsp; The
scenery is <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>far finer than that offered by Queenstown and
Liverpool.&nbsp; You have the Scilly Isles to look at, and the
Land&rsquo;s End, and the Lizards.&nbsp; At Portland Bill we laid
off till a pilot came on board, and we had a good look at the
establishment where so many smart men are sent for a season, and
Weymouth heading the distant bay; and then what a fine sweep you
have up the Channel&mdash;crowded with craft of all kinds, from
the eight thousand ton steamer to the frail and awkward fishing
lugger&mdash;and round the Nore; whilst old towns and castles,
speaking not alone of the living present, but of the dead and
buried past, are to be seen.&nbsp; Even Americans, fond as they
are of modern life, feel the charm of that; whilst to the
returning traveller the landscape speaks of &lsquo;home, sweet
home.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">COLONIZATION IN CANADA.</p>
<p>I was glad to see, the other day, Mr. Morley&rsquo;s letter
advocating the propriety of taking up land and settling on it
some of the too numerous class who drift into our great cities,
finding no work to do in the country, there to lead indifferent
lives and come to an untimely end.</p>
<p>It is a step I have repeatedly advocated.&nbsp; Land is cheap
enough now; there is no occasion to wait for an Act of
Parliament.&nbsp; It is as easy to buy an estate, and to split it
up into small portions, of which each shareholder will become in
time the proprietor, as to form a building society, and thus
enable any man <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>to become his own landlord.&nbsp; But there are certain
drawbacks.&nbsp; There is the parson to be dealt with, who will
be sure to claim his higher tithes; there are burdens on
property, of which the working man, who is told by Mr.
Chamberlain that he is more heavily taxed than any other class of
the community (is not the reverse of this the case?), has no
idea; and last, and not least, there is the unfitness for peasant
proprietorship of the average English workman, who has no idea of
living on the scant fare of the peasant proprietor of Belgium or
France, or, I fear, of working as hard.&nbsp; Granting, however,
that he does, the great fact remains, that peasant proprietorship
is no remedy for all the ills of life, and that France has its
surplus population quite as badly off, and a great deal more
difficult to deal with than our own.</p>
<p>What is to be done to relieve the distress, the existence of
which all must own and deplore?&nbsp; I answer, Emigrate.</p>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>Emigration is the natural means of relieving the
poverty of a nation.&nbsp; Every man is an emigrant.&nbsp; No one
lives and dies in the village in which he was born.&nbsp; He
finds his way to the neighbouring town in search of work; then to
the great metropolis; then across the water to one or other of
our colonies.</p>
<p>Greece and Rome realized the fact that under no conditions
could a certain tract of territory maintain more than a certain
number of people, and had their settled plans of
emigration.&nbsp; In England, at any rate since the days of the
Pilgrim Fathers, we have too much left the matter to chance, and
an ordinary emigrant, with the ordinary want of backbone, it
seems to me, is just as likely to go to the dogs in New York, or
Toronto, or Melbourne, as in London.&nbsp; What we want is what
is now being attempted by the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge, the leading members of which have established <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>a Church
Colonization Land Society.&nbsp; Its object is to assist, in a
practicable, businesslike manner, on a remunerative basis, the
great and pressing work of emigration to the British colonies in
connection with the Church of England.</p>
<p>This society, I learn from a proof of a circular just placed
in my hands, issued by Canon Prothero, the chairman, will, under
proper safeguards, render temporary pecuniary aid in such cases
as approve themselves to the council, take charge of the
emigrants on the journey to the colony, provide for their
settlement on lands selected, from those acquired by the society,
provide temporary dwellings until the emigrants can put together
their own (the materials for which may be bought ready to hand,
or the society itself can erect dwellings for them), will break
up the land if desired, and secure for the emigrant religious
services similar to those enjoyed at home.</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>The
society have secured land in Manitoba, near the railway, which
land has been selected by a practical farmer, a Yorkshireman, who
is to act as local manager.&nbsp; The Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge have laid particular stress in looking after
the spiritual welfare of emigrants in all our colonies; and in
Liverpool, as some of my readers may be aware, the society have
placed the Rev. J. Bridger, of St. Nicholas Church, as
emigrants&rsquo; chaplain; chaplains have also been appointed at
several other ports, such as Plymouth, Glasgow, Cork, and
Londonderry; but, as is manifest, the great centre of emigration
is Liverpool, and there Mr. Bridger finds his hands full.</p>
<p>No pains are spared to show every attention to emigrants going
from or arriving at Liverpool, and occasionally Mr. Bridger sails
with the first party of emigrants to their new homes.&nbsp; It
seems to me that the idea of the Church Colonization Society is
the right <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>one; but that it might be further extended by sending
out at the same time the schoolmaster, and the doctor, and the
storekeeper, and the shoemaker, and tailor, and baker, and
butcher, and thus forming a village community.</p>
<p>It is at home impossible to realize the solitariness of the
settler&rsquo;s life, far away from friends and the civilizing
and elevating influences of home.&nbsp; I met men in the
North-West who seemed to have almost lost the power of speech, so
long had they been left on their homesteads alone.&nbsp;
Emigration in communities would do away with this state of
things.&nbsp; At present it is a serious sacrifice for a man with
a family to emigrate into a new country.&nbsp; It is not good for
man to be alone.&nbsp; As a rule, he degenerates on the prairie;
civilization is the gift of towns to humanity.&nbsp; A man does
not live on bread alone.&nbsp; He needs that his heart and head
be stimulated by contact with his fellow-men; <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>not, as in
the old country, in consequence of the extensive competition, by
rivalry for the crust of bread, but by mutual aid and
companionship in the great work of subduing the wilderness and
making it to rejoice and blossom as the rose.</p>
<p>In a month or two the emigration season will have commenced,
and there is no time to spare.&nbsp; Why cannot other
denominations do what the Church of England is now preparing to
do?&nbsp; Canada can feed and fatten millions, who in England
will have to live as a burden on the community.&nbsp; There is
many a man who does ill here who would do well there.&nbsp; We
are all more or less the creatures of circumstances.&nbsp; In
England the beershop has degraded the community, and many a man
finds it hard to get away from its foul companionship: here, he
declines into a criminal or a sot; there, not only will he be
neither the one nor the other, but he will develop all the better
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>tendencies of his character, and become a man.&nbsp;
Make him a peasant-proprietor at home, and the chances are the
old Adam in him will be too strong.&nbsp; Plant him in a colony,
he feels in a new world, with a new aim.&nbsp; Here, he is looked
down on: there, he is hailed as a man and a brother.&nbsp; We who
are old must stop at home; but there is no reason why our sons
should do so.&nbsp; Why should a young man be a drudge because
his father was a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water, when in
a colony there are many ways of becoming well-off to a man who
has good muscles and brains, has the sense to avail himself of
opportunity when it occurs, and to keep his money in his
pocket?&nbsp; I say Canada, because Canada is easy to get at, and
is yet almost in a virgin state.&nbsp; It is only recently that
it has been opened up by the Canadian Government and the Canadian
Pacific Railway.&nbsp; I say Canada, because Canada is English,
and I am an Englishman; <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>because the Canadian Government does
all it can to help the emigrant; and because the Canadians are
mostly healthy, honest men.&nbsp; Englishmen thrive there better,
at any rate, than they do in the United States, or in South
Africa.&nbsp; Arrangements for a colony can easily be made.&nbsp;
In London, the Canadian Pacific Railway have a fine office in
Cannon Street, where you can see for yourself what are the
results of farming in the North-West, and where you will find its
courteous and intelligent representative, Mr. Alexander Begg,
whose only fault is that he will persist in maintaining that the
English climate is killing him, and that he enjoys much better
health in that frosty Canada, the cold of which is a bugbear that
has kept too many away.&nbsp; Go to him, and he will tell you
where to plant your colony.&nbsp; The money which is now
squandered in keeping paupers at home surely might be better
spent in forming village communities in the boundless <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>plains of
the North-West.&nbsp; Let Dissenters imitate the Church.&nbsp;
Let them have their communities as the Church of England seek to
have theirs.&nbsp; Some people say the Salvationists are a
nuisance in our crowded cities: let General Booth betake himself
to Manitoba; he will find few people to complain of his
processions there.</p>
<p>But this is no subject to trifle about; day by day the poor
are becoming poorer, and the middle-classes and the rich
also.&nbsp; The leaders of the coming democracy seem unwilling to
recognise that fact, and are angry when I tell them it is better
to emigrate than to agitate in the old country for the ruin of
the capitalist, the destruction of our trade, the abolition of
the landlord, the advent of the working man&rsquo;s candidate,
and the rights of man.&nbsp; Are they the friends of the poor who
bid him stay where he is to cheapen the labour market, already
overstocked; to crowd the cities with an unwholesome pauperism;
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>to see
his sons ripen into thieves, and his daughters cast on the
streets; and to look forward to the workhouse as the refuge of
his old age?&nbsp; Even if we had a revolution as complete as
that of France, what then?&nbsp; Over-population will breed
sorrow and sickness and want and despair all the same.&nbsp; In
Canada, the man who cares to work is sure of his reward; he has a
future before him and his.</p>
<p>I am glad to find, since the above was written, there has been
formed by the Congregational Union a special emigration scheme,
of which the Rev. Andrew Mearns, of the Memorial Hall, Farringdon
Street, is Secretary, and that they have already sent out over a
hundred qualified emigrants.&nbsp; The outfit and passage money
of each man costs &pound;7, and it is proposed to give each
&pound;2 when he arrives in Canada.&nbsp; The men to be selected
are drawn from the ranks of the unemployed who are brought
together at the various Mission <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Halls.&nbsp; The case of each
applicant is fully examined, and the men themselves are
thoroughly tested as to their honest desire and ability to
work.&nbsp; The men having been approved and their record found
satisfactory, they are sent to the emigration agent of the
colony, who also examines into the cases of the various
applicants.&nbsp; This acceptance having been notified, the next
and, perhaps, the greatest difficulty is to provide a temporary
home for them in the colony to which they are to be sent.&nbsp;
As the result of much labour, each man will be sent to the care
of some gentleman in the colony, who will see that he is properly
provided for, and started in a fair way to obtain work.&nbsp;
They are thus going to various towns in the Dominion, such as
Kingston, Ontario, Ottawa, Hamilton, London, Toronto, St.
Thomas&rsquo;s, Bellville, and Guelph.&nbsp; Among those to whom
introduction has been given are directors of railways, officers
of Christian Associations, <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>gardeners, farmers, merchants, and
various ministers of influence.&nbsp; It is almost unnecessary to
add that the spiritual needs of the men have not been forgotten,
and in the kit of each one have been packed a Bible, supplied by
the kindness of the Bible Society&mdash;who have intimated their
willingness to make a similar presentation to every man the Union
sends out&mdash;and an assortment of suitable and practical
religious literature.</p>
<p>Thus far have I told the story of my Canadian
experiences.&nbsp; Those who wish to fully pursue the subject
will do well to get &lsquo;Picturesque Canada,&rsquo; now being
published by Messrs. Cassell and Co.</p>

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
